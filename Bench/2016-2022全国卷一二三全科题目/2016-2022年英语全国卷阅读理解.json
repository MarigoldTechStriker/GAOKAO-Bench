With shining dark eyes, he seems like the of kid who would enjoy public speaking.\nBut he’s, nervous.“I’m here to tell you today why you should … should…”Chris trips on the“-ld,”a. pronunciation difficulty for many non-native English speakers. His teacher ,Thomas Whaley ,is next to him, whispering support.“…Vote for …me …”Except for some stumbles, Chris is doing amazingly well. When he brings his speech to a nice conclusion ,Whaley invites the rest of the class to praise him.\nA son of immigrants, Chris stared learning English a little over three years ago. Whaley recalls(回想起)how at the beginning of the year，when called upon to read，Chris would excuse himself to go to the bathroom.\nLearning English as a second language can be a painful experience. What you need is a great teacher who lets you make mistakes. “It takes a lot for any student，” Whaley explains，“especially for a student who is learning English as their new language，to feel confident enough to say，‘I don’t know，but I want to know.’”\nWhaley got the idea of this second-grade presidential campaign project when he asked the children one day to raise their hands if they thought they could never be a president. The answer broke his heart. Whaley says the project is about more than just learning to read and speak in public. He wants these kids to learn to boast(夸耀)about themselves.\n“Boasting about yourself，and your best qualities,” Whaley says，“is very difficult for a child who came into the classroom not feeling confident.”\n24. What made Chris nervous？\nA. Telling a story.\tB. Making a speech.\nC. Taking a test.\tD. Answering a question.\n25. What does the underlined word “stumbles” in paragraph 2 refer to?\nA. Improper pauses.\tB. Bad manners.\tC. Spelling mistakes.\tD. Silly jokes.\n26. We can infer that the purpose of Whaley’s project is to _________.\nA. help students see their own strengths\nB. assess students’ public speaking skills\nC. prepare students for their future jobs\nD. inspire students’ love for politics\n27. Which of the following best describes Whaley as a teacher?\nA. Humorous.\tB. Ambitious.\tC. Caring.\tD. Demanding.\n",

            "question": "\n\nC\nAs data and identity theft becomes more and more common, the market is growing for biometric(生物测量)technologies—like fingerprint scans—to keep others out of private e-spaces. At present, these technologies are still expensive, though.\nResearchers from Georgia Tech say that they have come up with a low-cost device(装置)that gets around this problem: a smart keyboard. This smart keyboard precisely measures the cadence(节奏)with which one types and the pressure fingers apply to each key. The keyboard could offer a strong layer of security by analyzing things like the force of a user's typing and the time between key presses. These patterns are unique to each person. Thus, the keyboard can determine people's identities, and by extension, whether they should be given access to the computer it's connected to—regardless of whether someone gets the password right.\nIt also doesn't require a new type of technology that people aren't already familiar with. Everybody uses a keyboard and everybody types differently.\nIn a study describing the technology, the researchers had 100 volunteers type the word “touch”four times using the smart keyboard. Data collected from the device could be used to recognize different participants based on how they typed, with very low error rates. The researchers say that the keyboard should be pretty straightforward to commercialize and is mostly made of inexpensive, plastic-like parts. The team hopes to make it to market in the near future.\n28. Why do the researchers develop the smart keyboard?\nA. To reduce pressure on keys.\tB. To improve accuracy in typing\nC. To replace the password system.\tD. To cut the cost of e-space protection.\n29. What makes the invention of the smart keyboard possible？\nA. Computers are much easier to operate.\nB. Fingerprint scanning techniques develop fast.\nC. Typing patterns vary from person to person.\nD. Data security measures are guaranteed.\n30. What do the researchers expect of the smart keyboard？all 1o soisgitieoco oll.\nA. It'll be environment-friendly.\tB. It'll reach consumers soon.\nC. It'll be made of plastics\tD.

            "question": "\n\nD\nDuring the rosy years of elementary school(小学), I enjoyed sharing my dolls and jokes, which allowed me to keep my high social status. I was the queen of the playground. Then came my tweens and teens, and mean girls and cool kids. They rose in the ranks not by being friendly but by smoking cigarettes, breaking rules and playing jokes on others, among whom I soon found myself.\nPopularity is a well-explored subject in social psychology. Mitch Prinstein, a professor of clinical psychology sorts the popular into two categories: the likable and the status seekers. The likables’ plays-well-with-others qualities strengthen schoolyard friendships, jump-start interpersonal skills and, when tapped early, are employed ever after in life and work. Then there’s the kind of popularity that appears in adolescence: status born of power and even dishonorable behavior.\nEnviable as the cool kids may have seemed, Dr. Prinstein’s studies show unpleasant consequences. Those who were highest in status in high school, as well as those least liked in elementary school, are “most likely to engage(从事)in dangerous and risky behavior.”\nIn one study, Dr. Prinstein examined the two types of popularity in 235 adolescents, scoring the least liked, the most liked and the highest in status based on student surveys(调查研究). “We found that the least well-liked teens had become more aggressive over time toward their classmates. But so had those who were high in status. It clearly showed that while likability can lead to healthy adjustment, high status has just the opposite effect on us.\"\nDr. Prinstein has also found that the qualities that made the neighbors want you on a play date-sharing, kindness, openness — carry over to later years and make you better able to relate and connect with others.\nIn analyzing his and other research，Dr. Prinstein came to another conclusion: Not only is likability related to positive life outcomes, but it is also responsible for those outcomes, too. \"Being liked creates opportunities for learning and for new kinds of life experiences that help somebody gain an advantage, ” he said.\n32. What sort of girl was the author in her early years of elementary school?\nA. Unkind.\tB. Lonely.\tC. Generous.\tD. Cool.\n33. What is the second paragraph mainly about？\nA. The classification of the popular.\nB. The characteristics of adolescents.\nC. The importance of interpersonal skills.\nD. The causes of dishonorable behavior.\n34. What did Dr. Prinstein’s study find about the most liked kids?\nA. They appeared to be aggressive.\nB. They tended to be more adaptable.\nC. They enjoyed the highest status.\nD. They performed well academically.\n35. What is the best title for the text?\nA. Be Nice-You Won’t Finish Last\nB. The Higher the Status, the Beer\nC. Be the Best-You Can Make It\nD. More Self-Control, Less Aggressiveness\n",

There’s a welcome familiarity - but also sometimes a slight suspicion that time has changed you both, and thus the relationship. But books don’t change, people do. And that’s what makes the act of rereading so rich and transformative.\nThe beauty of rereading lies in the idea that our bond with the work is based on our present mental register. It’s true, the older I get, the more I feel time has wings. But with reading, it’s all about the present. It’s about the now and what one contributes to the now, because reading is a give and take between author and reader. Each has to pull their own weight.\nThere are three books I reread annually The first, which I take to reading every spring is Emest Hemningway’s A Moveable Feast. Published in 1964, it’s his classic memoir of 1920s Paris. The language is almost intoxicating (令人陶醉的)，an aging writer looking back on an ambitious yet simpler time. Another is Annie Dillard’s Holy the Firm, her poetic 1975 ramble (随笔) about everything and nothing. The third book is Julio Cortazar’s Save Twilight: Selected Poems, because poetry. And because Cortazar.\nWhile I tend to buy a lot of books, these three were given to me as gifs, which might add to the meaning I attach to them. But I imagine that, while money is indeed wonderful and necessary, rereading an author’s work is the highest currency a reader can pay them. The best books are the ones that open further as time passes. But remember, it’s you that has to grow and read and reread in order to better understand your friends.\n24. Why does the author like rereading?\nA. It evaluates the writer-reader relationship.\nB. It’s a window to a whole new world.\nC. It’s a substitute for drinking with a friend.\nD.

            "question": "\nC\nRace walking shares many fitness benefits with running, research shows, while most likely contributing to fewer injuries. It does, however, have its own problem.\nRace walkers are conditioned athletes. The longest track and field event at the Summer Olympics is the 50-kilometer race walk, which is about five miles longer than the marathon. But the sport’s rules require that a race walker’s knees stay straight through most of the leg swing and one foot remain in contact (接触) with the ground at all times. It’s this strange form that makes race walking such an attractive activity, however, says Jaclyn Norberg, an assistant professor of exercise science at Salem State University in Salem, Mass.\nLike running, race walking is physically demanding, she says, According to most calculations, race walkers moving at a pace of six miles per hour would burn about 800 calories(卡路里) per hour, which is approximately twice as many as they would burn walking, although fewer than running, which would probably burn about 1,000 or more calories per hour.\nHowever, race walking does not pound the body as much as running does, Dr. Norberg says. According to her research, runners hit the ground with as much as four times their body weight per step, while race walkers, who do not leave the ground, create only about 1.4 times their body weight with each step.\nAs a result, she says, some of the injuries associated with running, such as runner’s knee, are uncommon among race walkers. But the sport’s strange form does place considerable stress on the ankles and hips, so people with a history of such injuries might want to be cautious in adopting the sport. In fact, anyone wishing to try race walking should probably first consult a coach or experienced racer to learn proper technique, she says. It takes some practice.\n28. Why are race walkers conditioned athletes?\nA. They must run long distances.\nB. They are qualified for the marathon.\nC. They have to follow special rules.\nD. They are good at swinging their legs.\n29. What advantage does race walking have over running?\nA. It’s more popular at the Olympics.\nB. It’s less challenging physically.\nC. It’s more effective in body building.\nD. It’s less likely to cause knee injuries.\n30. What is Dr. Norberg’s suggestion for someone trying race walking?\nA. Getting experts’ opinions.\nB. Having a medical checkup.\nC. Hiring an experienced coach.\nD. Doing regular exercises.\n31. Which word best describes the author’s attitude to race walking?\nA. Skeptical.\tB. Objective.\nC. Tolerant.\tD. Conservative.\n",

A study conducted in Youngstown，Ohio，for example, discovered that greener areas of the city experienced less crime. In another，employees were shown to be 15% more productive when their workplaces were decorated with houseplants.\nThe engineers at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology(MIT)have taken it a step further changing the actual composition of plants in order to get them to perform diverse，even unusual functions. These include plants that have sensors printed onto their leaves to show when they’re short of water and a plant that can detect harmful chemicals in groundwater. ＂We’re thinking about how we can engineer plants to replace functions of the things that we use every day,＂explained Michael Strano, a professor of chemical engineering at MIT.\nOne of his latest projects has been to make plants glow(发光)in experiments using some common vegetables. Strano’s team found that they could create a faint light for three-and-a-half hours. The light，about one-thousandth of the amount needed to read by，is just a start. The technology, Strano said, could one day be used to light the rooms or even to turn tree into self-powered street lamps.\nin the future，the team hopes to develop a version of the technology that can be sprayed onto plant leaves in a one-off treatment that would last the plant’s lifetime. The engineers are also trying to develop an on and off＂switch＂where the glow would fade when exposed to daylight.\nLighting accounts for about 7% of the total electricity consumed in the US. Since lighting is often far removed from the power source(电源)-such as the distance from a power plant to street lamps on a remote highway-a lot of energy is lost during transmission(传输).\nGlowing plants could reduce this distance and therefore help save energy.\n32. What is the first paragraph mainly about?\nA. A new study of different plants.\nB. A big fall in crime rates.\nC. Employees from various workplaces.\nD. Benefits from green plants.\n33. What is the function of the sensors printed on plant leaves by MIT engineer?\nA. To detect plants’ lack of water\nB. To change compositions of plants\nC. To make the life of plants longer.\nD. To test chemicals in plants.\n34. What can we expect of the glowing plants in the future?\nA. They will speed up energy production.\nB. They may transmit electricity to the home.\nC. They might help reduce energy consumption.\nD. They could take the place of power plants.\n35. Which of the following can be the best title for the text?\nA. Can we grow more glowing plants?\nB. How do we live with glowing plants?\nC. Could glowing plants replace lamps?\nD. How are glowing plants made pollution-free?\n",

When the tiny creature arrived on January 31, she became the 40th black rhino to be born at the reserve. And officials at Port Lympne were delighted with the new arrival, especially as black rhinos are known for being difficult to breed in captivity (圈养).\nPaul Beer, head of rhino section at Port Lympne, said: “Obviously we're all absolutely delighted to welcome another calf to our black rhino family. She's healthy, strong and already eager to play and explore. Her mother, Solio, is a first-time mum and she is doing a fantastic job. It's still a little too cold for them to go out into the open, but as soon as the weather warms up, I have no doubt that the little one will be out and about exploring and playing every day.”\nThe adorable female calf is the second black rhino born this year at the reserve, but it is too early to tell if the calves will make good candidates to be returned to protected areas of the wild. The first rhino to be born at Port Lympne arrived on January 5 to first-time mother Kisima and weighed about 32kg. His mother, grandmother and great grandmother were all born at the reserve and still live there.\nAccording to the World Wildlife Fund, the global black rhino population has dropped as low as 5500, giving the rhinos a “critically endangered” status.\n4. Which of the following best describes the breeding programme?\nA. Costly.\tB. Controversial.\tC. Ambitious.\tD. Successful.\n5. What does Paul Beer say about the new-born rhino?\nA.

Everyone in the family settled quickly into the city except me. Without my beloved beaches and endless blue—sky days, I felt at a loss and out of place. Until I made a discovery.\nSouthbank, at an eastern bend in the Thames, is the center of British skateboarding, where the continuous crashing of skateboards left your head ringing .I loved it. I soon made friends with the local skaters. We spoke our own language. And my favorite: Safe. Safe meant cool. It meant hello. It meant don't worry about it. Once, when trying a certain trick on the beam（横杆）, I fell onto the stones, damaging a nerve in my hand, and Toby came over, helping me up: Safe, man. Safe. A few minutes later, when I landed the trick, my friends beat their boards loud, shouting: “ Safe! Safe! Safe!” And that's what mattered—landing tricks, being a good skater.\nWhen I was 15, my family moved to Washington. I tried skateboarding there, but the locals were far less welcoming. Within a couple of years, I'd given it up.\nWhen I returned to London in 2004, I found myself wandering down to Southbank, spending hours there. I've traveled back several times since, most recently this past spring. The day was cold but clear: tourists and Londoners stopped to watch the skaters. Weaving（穿梭）among the kids who rushed by on their boards, I found my way to the beam. Then a rail—thin teenager, in a baggy white T—shirt, skidded（滑）up to the beam. He sat next to me. He seemed not to notice the man next to him. But soon I caught a few of his glances. “I was a local here 20 years ago,” I told him. Then, slowly, he began to nod his head. “Safe, man. Safe.”\n“Yeah,” I said. “Safe.”\n8. What can we learn about the author soon after he moved to London?\nA. He felt disappointed.\tB. He gave up his hobby.\nC. He liked the weather there.\tD. He had disagreements with his family.\n9. What do the underlined words “Safe! Safe! Safe!” probably mean?\nA. Be careful!\tB. Well done!\tC. No way!\tD. Don't worry!\n10.

His face is almost the international symbol for genius. But we want to go beyond one man and explore the nature of genius itself. Why is it that some people are so much more intelligent or creative than the rest of us? And who are they? \nIn the sciences and arts, those praised as geniuses were most often white men, of European origin. Perhaps this is not a surprise. It's said that history is written by the victors, and those victors set the standards for admission to the genius club. When contributions were made by geniuses outside the club—women, or people of a different color or belief—they were unacknowledged and rejected by others.\nA study recently published by Science found that as young as age six, girls are less likely than boys to say that members of their gender(性别)are “really, really smart.” Even worse, the study found that girls act on that belief: Around age six they start to avoid activities said to be for children who are “really, really smart.” Can our planet afford to have any great thinkers become discouraged and give up? It doesn't take a genius to know the answer: absolutely not.\nHere's the good news. In a wired world with constant global communication, we're all positioned to see flashes of genius wherever they appear. And the more we look, the more we will see that social factors(因素)like gender, race, and class do not determine the appearance of genius. As a writer says, future geniuses come from those with “intelligence, creativity, perseverance(毅力), and simple good fortune, who are able to change the world.”\n12.

            "question": "\nB\nIn 1916, two girls of wealthy families, best friends from Auburn, N. Y.—Dorothy Woodruff and Rosamond Underwood—traveled to a settlement in the Rocky Mountains to teach in a one-room schoolhouse. The girls had gone to Smith College. They wore expensive clothes. So for them to move to Elkhead, Colo. to instruct the children whose shoes were held together with string was a surprise. Their stay in Elkhead is the subject of Nothing Daunted: The Unexpected Education of Two Society Girls in the West by Dorothy Wickenden, who is a magazine editor and Dorothy Woodruff’s granddaughter.\n Why did they go then? Well, they wanted to do something useful. Soon, however, they realized what they had undertaken.\nThey moved in with a local family, the Harrisons, and, like them, had little privacy, rare baths, and a blanket of snow on their quilt when they woke up in the morning. Some mornings, Rosamond and Dorothy would arrive at the schoolhouse to find the children weeping from the cold. In spring, the snow was replaced by mud over ice. \nIn Wickenden’s book, she expanded on the history of the West and also on feminism, which of course influenced the girls’ decision to go to Elkhead. A hair-raising section concerns the building of the railroads, which entailed (牵涉) drilling through the Rockies, often in blinding snowstorms. The book ends with Rosamond and Dorothy’s return to Auburn.\nWickenden is a very good storyteller. The sweep of the land and the stoicism (坚忍) of the people move her to some beautiful writing. Here is a picture of Dorothy Woodruff, on her horse, looking down from a hill top: “When the sun slipped behind the mountains, it shed a rosy glow all around them. Then a full moon rose. The snow was marked only by small animals: foxes, coyotes, mice, and varying hares, which turned white in the winter.” \n4. Why did Dorothy and Rosamond go to the Rocky Mountains?\nA. To teach in a school.\tB. To study American history.\nC. To write a book.\tD. To do sightseeing.\n5. What can we learn about the girls from paragraph 3?\nA. They enjoyed much respect.\tB. They had a room with a bathtub.\nCThey lived with the local kids.\tD. They suffered severe hardships.\n6. Which part of Wickenden’s writing is hair-raising?\nA. The extreme climate of Auburn.\tB. The living conditions in Elkhead.\nC. The railroad building in the Rockies.\tD. The natural beauty of the West.\n7. What is the text?\nA. A news report.\tB. A book review.\tC. A children’s story.\tD. A diary entry.\n",

That is the very likely future of applying today’s “eyes in the sky” technology to making sure that the millions of kilometres of rail tracks and infrastructure(基础设施)worldwide are safe for trains on a 24/7 basis. \nDrones are already being used to examine high-tension electrical lines. They could do precisely the same thing to inspect railway lines and other vital aspects of rail infrastructure such as the correct position of railway tracks and switching points. The more regularly they can be inspected, the more railway safety, reliability and on-time performance will be improved. Costs would be cut and operations would be more efficient(高效)across the board. \nThat includes huge savings in maintenance costs and better protection of railway personnel safety. It is calculated that European railways alone spend approximately 20 billion euros a year on maintenance, including sending maintenance staff, often at night, to inspect and repair the rail infrastructure. That can be dangerous work that could be avoided with drones assisting the crews’ efforts. \nBy using the latest technologies, drones could also start providing higher-value services for railways, detecting faults in the rail or switches, before they can cause any safety problems. To perform these tasks, drones for rail don’t need to be flying overhead. Engineers are now working on a new concept: the rail drones of the future. They will be moving on the track ahead of the train, and programmed to run autonomously. Very small drones with advanced sensors and AI and travelling ahead of the train could guide it like a co-pilot. With their ability to see ahead, they could signal any problem, so that fast-moving trains would be able to react in time.\n8. What makes the application of drones to rail lines possible?\nA. The use of drones in checking on power lines.\tB. Drones’ ability to work at high altitudes.\nC. The reduction of cost in designing drones.\tD. Drones’ reliable performance in remote areas.\n9.

            "question": "\nD\nThe Government's sugar tax on soft drinks has brought in half as much money as Ministers first predicted it would generate, the first official data on the policy has shown. \nFirst announced in April, 2016, the tax which applies to soft drinks containing more than 5g of sugar per 100ml, was introduced to help reduce childhood obesity（肥胖）. It is believed that today's children and teenagers are consuming three times the recommended level of sugar, putting them at a higher risk of the disease. \nInitially the sugar tax was expected to make £520m a year for the Treasury. However, data of the first six months showed it would make less than half this amount. At present it is expected to generate £240m for the year ending in April 2019, which will go to school sports. \nIt comes after more than half of soft drinks sold in shops have had their sugar levels cut by manufacturers（制造商）so they can avoid paying the tax. Drinks now contain 45 million fewer kilos of sugar as a result of manufacturers' efforts to avoid the charge, according to Treasury figures. Since April drinks companies have been forced to pay between 18p and 24p for every litre of sugary drink they produce or import, depending on the sugar content. \nHowever, some high sugar brands, like Classic Coca Cola, have accepted the sugar tax and are refusing to change for fear of upsetting consumers. Fruit juices, milk-based drinks and most alcoholic drinks are free of the tax, as are small companies manufacturing fewer than 1m litres per year. \nToday's figures, according to one government official, show the positive influence the sugar tax is having by raising millions of pounds for sports facilities（设施）and healthier eating in schools. Helping the next generation to have a healthy and active childhood is of great importance, and the industry is playing its part. \n12. Why was the sugar tax introduced?\nA. To collect money for schools.\tB. To improve the quality of drinks.\nC. To protect children’s health.\tD. To encourage research in education.\n13. How did some drinks companies respond to the sugar tax?\nA. They turned to overseas markets.\tB. They raised the prices of their products.\nC. They cut down on their production.\tD. They reduced their products’ sugar content.\n14. From which of the following is the sugar tax collected?\nA. Most alcoholic drinks.\tB. Milk-based drinks.\tC. Fruit juices.\tD. Classic Coke.\n15. What can be inferred about the adoption of the sugar tax policy?\nA. It is a short-sighted decision.\tB. It is a success story.\nC. It benefits manufacturers.\tD. It upsets customers.\n",

But they weren’t there to throw red paint on fur-coat-wearing film stars. Instead, one activist, dressed in a full-body monkey suit, had arrived with a sign praising the filmmakers: “Thanks for not using real apes (猿)!”\nThe creative team behind “Apes” used motion-capture (动作捕捉) technology to create digitalized animals, spending tens of millions of dollars on technology that records an actor’s performance and later processes it with computer graphics to create a final image (图像). In this case, one of a realistic-looking ape.\nYet “Apes” is more exception than the rule. In fact, Hollywood has been hot on live animals lately. One nonprofit organization, which monitors the treatment of animals in filmed entertainment, is keeping tabs on more than 2,000 productions this year. Already, a number of films, including “Water for Elephants,” “The Hangover Part Ⅱ” and “Zookeeper,” have drawn the anger of activists who say the creatures acting in them haven’t been treated properly.\nIn some cases, it’s not so much the treatment of the animals on set in the studio that has activists worried; it’s the off-set training and living conditions that are raising concerns. And there are questions about the films made outside the States, which sometimes are not monitored as closely as productions filmed in the States.\n24. Why did the animal activists gather on Hollywood Boulevard?\nA. To see famous film stars.\nB. To oppose wearing fur coats.\nC. To raise money for animal protection.\nD.

She may just need a little persuading. So I try again and tug at the heartstrings. I mention the single parent with four kids running the show and I talk about the dad coaching a team that his kids aren’t even on … At this point the unwilling parent speaks up,“Alright. Yes, I’ll do it.”\nI’m secretly relieved because I know there’s real power in sharing volunteer responsibilities among many. The unwilling parent organizes the meal schedule, sends out emails, and collects money for end-of-season gifts. Somewhere along the way, the same parent ends up becoming an invaluable member of the team. The coach is able to focus on the kids while the other parents are relieved to be off the hook for another season. Handing out sliced oranges to bloodthirsty kids can be as exciting as watching your own kid score a goal.\nStill, most of us volunteers breathe a sigh of relief when the season comes to a close. That relief is coupled with a deep understanding of why the same people keep coming back for more: Connecting to the community(社区)as you freely give your time, money, skills, or services provides a real joy. Volunteering just feels so good.\nIn that sense, I’m pretty sure volunteering is more of a selfish act than I’d freely like to admit. However, if others benefit in the process, and I get some reward too, does it really matter where my motivation lies?\n24. What can we infer about the parent from her reply in paragraph l？\nA. She knows little about the club.\nB. She isn't good at sports.\nC. She just doesn't want to volunteer.\nD. She's unable to meet her schedule.\n25. What does the underlined phrase“tug at the heartstrings”in paragraph 2 mean ?\nA. Encourage team work.\nB. Appeal to feeling.\nC. Promote good deeds\nD. Provide advice.\n26. What can we learn about the parent from paragraph 3?\nA. She gets interested in lacrosse.\nB. She is proud of her kids.\nC. She’ll work for another season.\nD. She becomes a good helper.\n27. Why does the author like doing volunteer work?\nA. It gives her a sense of duty.\nB. It makes her very happy.\nC. It enables her to work hard.\nD. It brings her material rewards.\n",

Though not known to use tools in the wild, the birds have proved skilful at tool use while kept in the cage. In a recent experiment, cockatoos were presented with a box with a nut inside it. The clear front of the box had a “keyhole” in a geometric shape, and the birds were given five differently shaped “keys” to choose from. Inserting the correct “key” would let out the nut.\nIn humans, babies can put a round shape in a round hole from around one year of age, but it will be another year before they are able to do the same with less symmetrical (对称的) shapes. This ability to recognize that a shape will need to be turned in a specific direction before it will fit is called an “allocentric frame of reference”. In the experiment, Goffin’s cockatoos were able to select the right tool for the job, in most cases, by visual recognition alone. Where trial-and-error was used, the cockatoos did better than monkeys in similar tests. This indicates that Goffin’s cockatoos do indeed possess an allocentric frame of reference when moving objects in space, similar to two-year-old babies.\nThe next step, according to the researchers, is to try and work out whether the cockatoos rely entirely on visual clues (线索), or also use a sense of touch in making their shape selections.\n4. How did the cockatoos get the nut from the box in the experiment?\nA. By following instructions.\tB. By using a tool.\nC. By turning the box around.\tD. By removing the lid.\n5.

Then, one after another, Sydney discovered lots of things that were just sort of there — broad parks, superb beaches, and a culturally diverse population. But it is the harbor that makes the city.\nAndrew Reynolds, a cheerful fellow in his early 30s, pilots Sydney ferryboats for a living. I spent the whole morning shuttling back and forth across the harbor. After our third run Andrew shut down the engine, and we went our separate ways — he for a lunch break, I to explore the city.\n“I’ll miss these old boats,” he said as we parted.\n“How do you mean?” I asked.\n“Oh, they’re replacing them with catamarans. Catamarans are faster, but they’re not so elegant, and they’re not fun to pilot. But that’s progress, I guess.”\nEverywhere in Sydney these days, change and progress are the watchwords (口号), and traditions are increasingly rare. Shirley Fitzgerald, the city’s official historian, told me that in its rush to modernity in the 1970s, Sydney swept aside much of its past, including many of its finest buildings. “Sydney is confused about itself,” she said. “We can’t seem to make up our minds whether we want a modern city or a traditional one. It’s a conflict that we aren’t getting any better at resolving (解决).”\nOn the other hand, being young and old at the same time has its attractions. I considered this when I met a thoughtful young businessman named Anthony. “Many people say that we lack culture in this country,” he told me. “What people forget is that the Italians, when they came to Australia, brought 2000 years of their culture, the Greeks some 3000 years, and the Chinese more still. We’ve got a foundation built on ancient cultures but with a drive and dynamism of a young country. It’s a pretty hard combination to beat.”\nHe is right, but I can’t help wishing they would keep those old ferries.\n12. What is the first paragraph mainly about?\nA. Sydney’s striking architecture.\tB. The cultural diversity of Sydney.\nC. The key to Sydney’s development.\tD. Sydney’s tourist attractions in the 1960s.\n13. What can we learn about Andrew Reynolds?\nA. He goes to work by boat.\tB. He looks forward to a new life.\nC. He pilots catamarans well.\tD. He is attached to the old ferries.\n14. What does Shirley Fitzgerald think of Sydney?\nA. It is losing its traditions.\tB. It should speed up its progress.\nC. It should expand its population.\tD. It is becoming more international.\n15. Which statement will the author probably agree with?\nA. A city can be young and old at the same time.\nB. A city built on ancient cultures is more dynamic.\nC. modernity is usually achieved at the cost of elegance.\nD. Compromise should be made between the local and the foreign.\n",

The exhibition had record attendance, showing that there is huge interest in Chinese influences.\n\"China is impossible to overlook,\" says Hill. \"Chinese models are the faces of beauty and fashion campaigns that sell dreams to women all over the world, which means Chinese women are not just consumers of fashion — they are central to its movement. \"Of course, only are today's top Western designers being influenced by China-some of the best designers of contemporary fashion are themselves Chinese.\" Vera Wang, Alexander Wang, Jason Wu are taking on Galiano, Albaz, Marc Jacobs-and beating them hands down in design and sales,\" adds Hil.\nFor Hill, it is impossible not to talk about China as the leading player when discussing fashion. \"The most famous designers are Chinese, so are the models, and so are the consumers,\" she says. \"China is no longer just another market; in many senses it has become the market.

            "question": "\n\nC\nBefore the 1830s,most newspapers were sold through annual subscriptions in America, usually $8 to $10 a year. Today $8 or $10 seems a small amount of money, but at that time these amounts were forbidding to most citizens. Accordingly, newspapers were read almost only by rich people in politics or the trades. In addition, most newspapers had little in them that would appeal to a mass audience. They were dull and visually forbidding. But the revolution that was taking place in the 1830s would change all that.\nThe trend, then, was toward the \"penny paper\"-a term referring to papers made widely available to the public. It meant any inexpensive newspaper; perhaps more importantly it meant newspapers that could be bought in single copies on the street.\nThis development did not take place overnight. It had been possible(but not easy)to buy single copies of newspapers before 1830,but this usually meant the reader had to go down to the printer's office to purchase a copy. Street sales were almost unknown. However, within a few years, street sales of newspapers would be commonplace in eastern cities. At first the price of single copies was seldom a penny-usually two or three cents was charged-and some of the older well-known papers charged five or six cents. But the phrase \"penny paper \" caught the public's fancy, and soon there would be papers that did indeed sell for only a penny.\nThis new trend of newspapers for \"the man on the street\" did not begin well. Some of the early ventures(企业)were immediate failures. Publishers already in business, people who were owners of successful papers, had little desire to change the tradition. It took a few youthful and daring businessmen to get the ball rolling.\n28. Which of the following best describes newspapers in America before the 1830s?\nA. Academic.\tB. Unattractive.\tC. Inexpensive.\tD. Confidential.\n29. What did street sales mean to newspapers?\nA. They would be priced higher.\tB. They would disappear from cities.\nC. They could have more readers.\tD. They could regain public trust.\n30. Who were the newspapers of the new trend targeted at?\nA. Local politicians.\tB. Common people.\nC. Young publishers.\tD. Rich businessmen.\n31. What can we say about the birth of the penny paper?\nA. It was a difficult process.\tB. It was a temporary success.\nC. It was a robbery of the poor.\tD. It was a disaster for printers.\n",

In addition ,most newspapers had little in them that would appeal to mass audience. They were dull and visually forbidding.”可知，在19世纪30年代之前,只有富人才能读报纸，而且大多数报纸中几乎没有能吸引大众的内容，让人感觉无聊，，视觉上令人望而却步。由此可得出那时的报纸没有什么吸引力。分析选项，A . Academic学术的；B. Unattractive没有吸引力， 无魅力的； C. Inexpensive廉价的，不贵的； D. Confidential机密的，保密的。可知 A、C和D是错误的，只有B符合题意，故选B。\n【29题详解】\n推理判断题。根据第二段提到“便士报纸”针对大众，很便宜的。更重要的是，在街上可以买的到报纸。 结合第三段中间的“streets sales of newspapers would be commonplaced in eastern cities”可知，报纸的街头销售随处可见。由此可推断出，街头销售意味读报纸的多了。分析选项可知C符合题，故选C。\n【30题详解】\n细节理解题。根据第二段中的“The trend, then, was ‘penny paper’—a term referring to papers made widely available to the public. perhaps more importantly it meant newspapers that could be bought in single copies on the street.”可知，这种“便士报纸”针对大众的，在街上可以买的到报纸。分析选项可知，选项B符合题意，故选B。\n【31题详解】\n推理判断题。第二段“The trend, then, was ‘penny paper’”及最后一段“The new trend of newspapers for ‘the man on the street’ did not begin well. Some of the early ventures were immediately failures. Publishers already in business, people who owners of successful papers, had little desires to change the tradition. It took a few youthful and daring businessmen to get the ball rolling.”可知，“便士报纸”新趋势一开始并不好，一些早期的尝试立即失败了。已经进入商业领域的成功的出版商，并不想改变这一传统。后来一些年轻而大胆的商人才推动了这件事。由此可推断出“便士报纸”的诞生是一个困难而曲折的过程。分析选项可知，A项符合题意，故选A。",

The researchers then tested how the monkeys combined—or added—the symbols to get the reward.\nHere's how Harvard Medical School scientist Margaret Livingstone, who led the team, described the experiment: In their cages the monkeys were provided with touch screens. On one part of the screen, a symbol would appear, and on the other side two symbols inside a circle were shown. For example, the number 7 would flash on one side of the screen and the other end would have 9 and 8. If the monkeys touched the left side of the screen they would be rewarded with seven drops of water or juice; if they went for the circle, they would be rewarded with the sum of the numbers—17 in this example.\nAfter running hundreds of tests, the researchers noted that the monkeys would go for the higher values more than half the time, indicating that they were performing a calculation, not just memorizing the value of each combination.\nWhen the team examined the results of the experiment more closely, they noticed that the monkeys tended to underestimate(低估)a sum compared with a single symbol when the two were close in value—sometimes choosing, for example, a 13 over the sum of 8 and 6. The underestimation was systematic: When adding two numbers, the monkeys always paid attention to the larger of the two, and then added only a fraction(小部分)of the smaller number to it.\n\"This indicates that there is a certain way quantity is represented in their brains, \"Dr. Livingstone says. “But in this experiment what they're doing is paying more attention to the big number than the little one.”\n32.

How did the monkeys get their reward in the experiment?\nA. By drawing a circle.\tB. By touching a screen.\nC. By watching videos.\tD. By mixing two drinks.\n34.

But some ecologists and fashion (时装)enthusiasts are trying to bring back the market for fur made from nutria(海狸鼠).\nUnusual fashion shows in New Orleans and Brooklyn have showcased nutria fur made into clothes in different styles. “It sounds crazy to talk about guilt-free fur-unless you understand that the nutria are destroying vast wetlands every year”, says Cree McCree, project director of Righteous Fur.\nScientists in Louisiana were so concerned that they decided to pay hunters $5 a tail. Some of the fur ends up in the fashion shows like the one in Brooklyn last month.\nNutria were brought there from Argentina by fur farmers and let go into the wild. “The ecosystem down there can’t handle this non-native species(物种).It’s destroying the environment.

In fact plenty of younger kids have one in their pocket. Practically everyone can make and receive calls anywhere, anytime. \nStill, 55 percent of Australians have a landline phone at home and only just over a quarter （29%） rely only on their smartphones according to a survey （调查）. Of those Australians who still have a landline, a third concede that it’s not really necessary and they’re keeping it as a security blanket — 19 percent say they never use it while a further 13 percent keep it in case of emergencies. I think my home falls into that category. \nMore than half of Australian homes are still choosing to stick with their home phone. Age is naturally a factor（因素）— only 58 percent of Generation Ys still use landlines now and then, compared to 84 percent of Baby Boomers who’ve perhaps had the same home number for 50 years. Age isn’t the only factor; I’d say it’s also to do with the makeup of your household. \nGeneration Xers with young families, like my wife and I, can still find it convenient to have a home phone rather than providing a mobile phone for every family member. That said, to be honest the only people who ever ring our home phone are our Baby Boomers parents, to the point where we play a game and guess who is calling before we pick up the phone（using Caller ID would take the fun out of it）. \nHow attached are you to your landline?

Annoyed by the level of distraction（干扰）in his open office, he said, “That’s why I have a membership at the coworking space across the street — so I can focus”. His comment struck me as strange. After all, coworking spaces also typically use an open office layout（布局）. But I recently came across a study that shows why his approach works. \nThe researchers examined various levels of noise on participants as they completed tests of creative thinking. They were randomly divided into four groups and exposed to various noise levels in the background, from total silence to 50 decibels（分贝）, 70 decibels, and 85 decibels. The differences between most of the groups were statistically insignificant; however, the participants in the 70 decibels group — those exposed to a level of noise similar to background chatter in a coffee shop — significantly outperformed the other groups. Since the effects were small, this may suggest that our creative thinking does not differ that much in response to total silence and 85 decibels of background noise. \nBut since the results at 70 decibels were significant, the study also suggests that the right level of background noise — not too loud and not total silence — may actually improve one’s creative thinking ability. The right level of background noise may interrupt our normal patterns of thinking just enough to allow our imaginations to wander, without making it impossible to focus. This kind of “distracted focus” appears to be the best state for working on creative tasks. \nSo why do so many of us hate our open offices? The problem may be that, in our offices, we can’t stop ourselves from getting drawn into others’ conversations while we’re trying to focus. Indeed, the researchers found that face-to-face interactions and conversations affect the creative process, and yet a coworking space or a coffee shop provides a certain level of noise while also providing freedom from interruptions.\n32 Why does the interviewer prefer a coworking space?\nA. It helps him concentrate.\tB. It blocks out background noise.\nC. It has a pleasant atmosphere.\tD. It encourages face-to-face interactions.\n33. Which level of background noise may promote creative thinking ability?\nA. Total silence.\tB. 50 decibels\tC. 70 decibels.\tD. 8 5 decibels.\n34.

It was a scene that had been repeated many times in the theater’s 75-year history. This time, however, the cleanup was a little different. As one group of workers carried out the rubbish, another group began removing seats and other theater equipment in preparation for the building’s end.\nThe film classic The Last Picture Show was the last movie shown in the old theater. Though the movie is 30 years old, most of the 250 seats were filled with teary-eyed audience wanting to say good-bye to the old building. Theater owner Ed Bradford said he chose the movie because it seemed appropriate. The movie is set in a small town where the only movie theater is preparing to close down.\nBradford said that large modern theaters in the city made it impossible for the Plaza to compete. He added that the theater’s location (位置) was also a reason. “This used to be the center of town,” he said. “Now the area is mostly office buildings and warehouses.”\nLast week some city officials suggested the city might be interested in turning the old theater into a museum and public meeting place. However, these plans were abandoned because of financial problems. Bradford sold the building and land to a local development firm, which plans to build a shopping complex on the land where the theater is located.\nThe theater audience said good-bye as Bradford locked the doors for the last time. After 75 years the Plaza Theater has shown its last movie. The theater will be missed.\n24. In what way was yesterday’s cleanup at the Plaza special?\nA. It made room for new equipment.\nB. It signaled the closedown of the theater.\nC. It was done with the help of the audience.\nD. It marked the 75th anniversary of the theater.\n25. Why was The Last Picture Show put on?\nA. It was an all-time classic.     \t\tB. It was about the history of the town.\nC. The audience requested it.     \tD. The theater owner found it suitable.\n26. What will probably happen to the building?\nA. It will be repaired.      \t\tB. It will be turned into a museum.\nC. It will be knocked down.    \tD. It will be sold to the city government. \n27. What can we infer about the audience?\nA. They are disappointed with Bradford.  \nB. They are sad to part with the old theater. \nC. They are supportive of the city officials.  \nD.

            "question": "\n　\nC\nAfter years of heated debate, gray wolves were reintroduced to Yellowstone National Park. Fourteen wolves were caught in Canada and transported to the park. By last year, the Yellowstone wolf population had grown to more than 170 wolves.\nGray wolves once were seen here and there in the Yellowstone area and much of the continental United States, but they were gradually displaced by human development. By the 1920s, wolves had practically disappeared from the Yellowstone area. They went farther north into the deep forests of Canada, where there were fewer humans around.\nThe disappearance of the wolves had many unexpected results. Deer and elk populations — major food sources (来源) for the wolf — grew rapidly. These animals consumed large amounts of vegetation (植被), which reduced plant diversity in the park. In the absence of wolves, coyote populations also grew quickly. The coyotes killed a large percentage of the park’s red foxes, and completely drove away the park’s beavers.\nAs early as 1966, biologists asked the government to consider reintroducing wolves to Yellowstone Park. They hoped that wolves would be able to control the elk and coyote problems. Many farmers opposed the plan because they feared that wolves would kill their farm animals or pets.\n    The government spent nearly 30 years coming up with a plan to reintroduce the wolvers. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service carefully monitors and manages the wolf packs in Yellowstone. Today, the debate continues over how well the gray wolf is fitting in at Yellowstone. Elk, deer, and coyote populations are down, while beavers and red fores have made a comeback. The Yellowstone wolf project has been a valuable experiment to help biologists decide whether to reintroduce wolves to other parts of the country as well.\n28. What is the text mainly about?\nA. Wildlife research in the United States.\nB. Plant diversity in the Yellowstone area.\nC. The conflict between farmers and gray wolves.\nD. The reintroduction of wolves to Yellowstone Park.\n29. What does the underlined word “displaced” in paragraph 2 mean?\nA. Tested.\t\tB. Separated.\t\tC. Forced out.\t\tD. Tracked down.\n30. What did the disappearance of gray wolves bring about？\nA. Damage to local ecology.     B. A decline in the park’s income.\nC. Preservation of vegetation.    D. An increase in the variety of animals.\n31. What is the author’s attitude towards the Yellowstone wolf project？\nA. Doubtful.       B. Positive.      C. Disapproving.      D. Uncaring.\n",

Phil Blythe explains: “For many older people, particularly those living alone or in the country, driving is important for preserving their independence, giving them the freedom to get out and about without having to rely on others.”\n“But we all have to accept that as we get older our reactions slow down and this often results in people avoiding any potentially challenging driving conditions and losing confidence in their driving skills. The result is that people stop driving before they really need to.”\nDr Amy Guo, the leading researcher on the older driver study, explains, “The Drive LAB is helping us to understand what the key points and difficulties are for older drivers and how we might use technology to address these problems.\n“For example, most of us would expect older drivers always go slower than everyone else but surprisingly, we found that in 30mph zones they struggled to keep at a constant speed and so were more likely to break the speed limit and be at risk of getting fined. We’re looking at the benefits of systems which control their speed as a way of preventing that.\n“We hope that our work will help with technological solutions (解决方案) to ensure that older drivers stay safer behind the wheel.”\n32.

People settle in these places because they are easy to get to and naturally suited to communications and trade. New York City, for example, is near a large harbour at the mouth of the Hudson River. Over 300 years its population grew gradually from 800 people to 8 million. But not all cities develop slowly over a long period of time. Boom towns grow from nothing almost overnight. In 1896, Dawson, Canada, was unmapped wilderness (荒野). But gold was discovered there in 1897, and two years later, it was one of the largest cities in the West, with a population of 30,000.\nDawson did not have any of the natural conveniences of cities like London or Paris. People went there for gold. They travelled over snow-covered mountains and sailed hundreds of miles up icy rivers. The path to Dawson was covered with thirty feet of wet snow that could fall without warming. An avalanche(雪崩) once closed the path, killing 63 people. For many who made it to Dawson, however, the rewards were worth the difficult trip. Of the first 20,000 people who dug for gold, 4,000 got rich. About 100 of these stayed rich men for the rest of their lives.\nBut no matter how rich they were, Dawson was never comfortable. Necessities like food and wood were very expensive. But soon, the gold that Dawson depended on had all been found. The city was crowded with disappointed people with no interest in settling down, and when they heard there were new gold discoveries in Alaska, they left Dawson City as quickly as they had come. Today, people still come and go — to see where the Canadian gold rush happened. Tourism is now the chief industry of Dawson City — its present population is 762.\n24. What attracted the early settlers to New York City?\nA. Its business culture.            B. Its small population.[来]\nC. Its geographical position.        D. Its favourable climate.\n25. What do we know about those who first dug for gold in Dawson?\nA. Two-thirds of them stayed there.      B. One out of five people got rich.\nC. Almost everyone gave up.           D. Half of them died.\n26. What was the main reason for many people to leave Dawson?\nA. They found the city too crowded.   B. They wanted to try their luck elsewhere.\nC. They were unable to stand the winter.   D. They were short of food.\n27. What is the text mainly about?\nA. The rise and fall of a city.         B. The gold rush in Canada.\nC.

Wang Shu, a 49-year-old Chinese architect, won the 2012 Pritzker Architecture Prize — which is often referred to as the Nobel Prize in architecture — on February 28. He is the first Chinese citizen to win this award.\nWang serves as head of the Architecture Department at the China Academy of Art (CAA). His office is located at the Xiangshan campus (校园) of the university in Hangzhou, Zhejiang Province. Many buildings on the campus are his original creations.\nThe style of the campus is quite different from that of most Chinese universities. Many visitors were amazed by the complex architectural space and abundant building types. The curves (曲线) of the buildings perfectly match the rise and fall of hills, forming a unique view.\nWang collected more than 7 million abandoned bricks of different ages. He asked the workers to use traditional techniques to make the bricks into walls, roofs and corridors. This creation attracted a lot of attention thanks to its mixture of modern and traditional Chinese elements (元素).\nWang’s works show a deep understanding of modern architecture and a good knowledge of traditions. Through such a balance, he had created a new type of Chinese architecture, said Tadao Ando, the winner of the 1995 Pritzker Prize.\nWang believes traditions should not be sealed in glass boxes at museums. “That is only evidence that traditions once existed,” he said.\n“Many Chinese people have a misunderstanding of traditions. They think tradition means old things from the past. In fact, tradition also refers to the things that have been developing and that are still being created,” he said.\n“Today, many Chinese people are learning Western styles and theories rather than focusing on Chinese traditions. Many people tend to talk about traditions without knowing what they really are,” said Wang.学K]\nThe study of traditions should be combined with practice. Otherwise, the recreation of traditions would be artificial and empty, he said.\n28. Wang’s winning of the prize means that Chinese architects are ___________.\nA. following the latest world trend       B. getting international recognition\nC. working harder than ever before       D. relying on foreign architects\n29. What impressed visitors to the CAA Xiangshan campus most?\nA. Its hilly environment. \tB. Its large size.\nC. Its unique style.\t\t\tD. Its diverse functions.\n30. What made Wang’s architectural design a success?\nA. The mixture of different shapes.       B. The balance of East and West.\nC. The use of popular techniques.        D. The harmony of old and new.\n31. What should we do about Chinese traditions according to Wang?\nA. Spread them to the world.\t\t\tB. Preserve them at museums.\nC. Teach them in universities.\t\t\tD.

            "question": "\n　\nD\nAdults understand what it feels like to be flooded with objects. Why do we often assume that more is more when it comes to kids and their belongings? The good news is that I can help my own kids learn earlier than I did how to live more with less. \nI found the pre-holidays a good time to encourage young children to donate less-used things, and it worked. Because of our efforts, our daughter Georgia did decide to donate a large bag of toys to a little girl whose mother was unable to pay for her holiday due to illness. She chose to sell a few larger objects that were less often used when we promised to put the money into her school fund (基金) (our kindergarten daughter is serious about becoming a doctor).\nFor weeks, I’ve been thinking of bigger, deeper questions: How do we make it a habit for them? And how do we train ourselves to help them live with, need, and use less? Yesterday, I sat with my son, Shepherd, determined to test my own theory on this. I decided to play with him with only one toy for as long as it would keep his interest. I expected that one toy would keep his attention for about five minutes, ten minutes, max. I chose a red rubber ball—simple, universally available. We passed it, he tried to put it in his mouth, he tried bouncing it, rolling it, sitting on it, throwing it. It was totally, completely enough for him. Before I knew it an hour had passed and it was time to move on to lunch.\nWe both became absorbed in the simplicity of playing together. He had my full attention and I had his. My little experiment to find joy in a single object worked for both of us.\n32. What do the words “more is more” in paragraph 1 probably mean?\nA. The more, the better.\t\t\t\t\tB. Enough is enough.\nC. More money, more worries.\t\t\tD. Earn more and spend more.\n33. What made Georgia agree to sell some of her objects?\nA. Saving up for her holiday \t\t\t\tB. Raising money for a poor girl\nC. Adding the money to her fund \t\t\tD. Giving the money to a sick mother\n34. Why did the author play the ball with Shepherd?\nA.

They settled in at a comfortable East Side cafe and within minutes, another customer was approaching their table.\n“Hey, aren’t you from Mississippi?” the elegant, white-haired writer remembered being asked by the stranger. “I’m from Mississippi too.”\n   Without a second thought, the woman joined the Welty party. When her dinner partner showed up, she also pulled up a chair.\n“They began telling me all the news of Mississippi,” Welty said. “I didn’t know what my New York friends were thinking.”\n    Taxis on a rainy New York night are rarer than sunshine. By the time the group got up to leave, it was pouring outside. Welty’s new friends immediately sent a waiter to find a cab. Heading back downtown toward her hotel, her big-city friends were amazed at the turn of events that had changed their Big Apple dinner into a Mississippi state reunion (团聚).\n“My friends said: ‘Now we believe your stories,’” Welty added. “And I said: ‘Now you know. These are the people that make me write them.’”\nSitting on a sofa in her room, Welty, a slim figure in a simple gray dress, looked pleased with this explanation.\n“I don’t make them up,” she said of the characters in her fiction these last 50 or so years. “I don’t have to.”\nBeauticians, bartenders, piano players and people with purple hats, Welty’s people come from afternoons spent visiting with old friends, from walks through the streets of her native Jackson, Miss., from conversations overheard on a bus. It annoys Welty that, at 78, her left ear has now given out. Sometimes, sitting on a bus or a train, she hears only a fragment (片段) of a particularly interesting story.\n25. What happened when Welty was with her friends at the cafe?\nA. Two strangers joined her.         B. Her childhood friends came in.\n  C. A heavy rain ruined the dinner.     D.

It’s called Apple Day but in practice it’s more like Apple Month. The day itself is on October 21, but since it has caught on, events now spread out over most of October around Britain.\nVisiting an apple event is a good chance to see, and often taste, a wide variety of apples. To people who are used to the limited choice of apples such as Golden Delicious and Royal Gala in supermarkets, it can be quite an eye opener to see the range of classical apples still in existence, such as Decio which was grown by the Romans. Although it doesn’t taste of anything special, it’s still worth a try, as is the knobbly (多疙瘩的) Cat’s Head which is more of a curiosity than anything else.\nThere are also varieties developed to suit specific local conditions. One of the very best varieties for eating quality is Orleans Reinette, but you’ll need a warm, sheltered place with perfect soil to grow it, so it’s a pipe dream for most apple lovers who fall for it.\nAt the events, you can meet expert growers and discuss which ones will best suit your conditions, and because these are family affairs, children are well catered for with apple-themed fun and games.\nApple Days are being held at all sorts of places with an interest in fruit, including stately gardens and commercial orchards (果园). If you want to have a real orchard experience, try visiting the National Fruit Collection at Brogdale, near Faversham in Kent.\n28. What can people do at the apple events?\nA. Attend experts’ lectures.             \tB. Visit fruit-loving families.\nC. Plant fruit trees in an orchard.     \t\tD. Taste many kinds of apples.\n29. What can we learn about Decio?\nA. It is a new variety.                \tB. It has a strange look.\nC. It is rarely seen now.               \tD. It has a special taste.\n30. What does the underlined phrase “a pipe dream” in Paragraph 3 mean?\nA. A practical idea.  \tB. A vain hope.  C. A brilliant plan.  D. A selfish desire.\n31. What is the author’s purpose in writing the text?\nA. To show how to grow apples.      B. To introduce an apple festival.\nC. To help people select apples.       D. To promote apple research.\n",

But now that information is being spread and monitored (监控) in different ways, researchers are discovering new rules. By tracking people’s e-mails and online posts, scientists have found that good news can spread faster and farther than disasters and sob stories.\n   “The ‘if it bleeds’ rule works for mass media,” says Jonah Berger, a scholar at the University of Pennsylvania. “They want your eyeballs and don’t care how you’re feeling. But when you share a story with your friends, you care a lot more how they react. You don’t want them to think of you as a Debbie Downer.”\n   Researchers analyzing word-of-mouth communication — e-mails, Web posts and reviews, face-to-face conversations — found that it tended to be more positive than negative (消极的), but that didn’t necessarily mean people preferred positive news. Was positive news shared more often simply because people experienced more good things than bad things? To test for that possibility, Dr. Berger looked at how people spread a particular set of news stories: thousands of articles on The New York Times’ website. He and a Penn colleague analyzed the “most e-mailed” list for six months. One of his first findings was that articles in the science section were much more likely to make the list than non-science articles. He found that science amazed Times’ readers and made them want to share this positive feeling with others.\nReaders also tended to share articles that were exciting or funny, or that inspired negative feelings like anger or anxiety, but not articles that left them merely sad. They needed to be aroused (激发) one way or the other, and they preferred good news to bad. The more positive an article, the more likely it was to be shared, as Dr. Berger explains in his new book, “Contagious: Why Things Catch On.” \n32. What do the classic rules mentioned in the text apply to?\nA. News reports.    \t    B. Research papers.  \t\t\nC. Private e-mails.    \tD. Daily conversations.\n33. What can we infer about people like Debbie Downer?\nA. They’re socially inactive.        B. They’re good at telling stories.\nC. They’re inconsiderate of others.   D. They’re careful with their words.\n34. Which tended to be the most e-mailed according to Dr. Berger’s research?\nA. Sports news.      \t  B. Science articles.    \t\t\nC. Personal accounts.  \t  D. Financial reviews.\n35. What can be a suitable title for the text?\nA. Sad Stories Travel Far and Wide       \nB .Online News Attracts More People\nC.
