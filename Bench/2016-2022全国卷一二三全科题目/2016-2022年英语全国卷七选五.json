In fact, the key to easy morning wake-up lies in resting your body clock   36     Here is how to make one.\n●    37     In order to make a change, you need to decide why it’s important. Do you want to get up in time to have breakfast with your family, get in some exercise, or just be better prepared for your day? Once you are clear about your reason, tell your family or roommates about the change you want to make.\nRethink mornings. Now that you know why you want to wake up, consider re-arranging your morning activities. If you want time to have breakfast with your family, save some time the night before by setting out clothes, shoes, and bags.    38   That’s a quarter-hour more you could be sleeping if you bought a coffee maker with a timer.\nKeep your sleep/wake schedule on weekends. If you’re tired out by Friday night, sleeping in on Saturday could sound wonderful. But compensating on the weekends actually feeds into your sleepiness the following week, a recent study found.   39   \nKeep a record and evaluate it weekly. Keep track of your efforts and write down how you feel. After you’ve tried a new method for a week, take a look at your record.    40    If not, take another look at other methods you could try.\nA. Get a sleep specialist.\nB. Find the right motivation.\nC. A better plan for sleep can help.\nD. And consider setting a second alarm.\nE. If the steps you take are working, keep it up.\nF.

Maybe you say “go,” or turn on a certain song, or whatever.”（设置开始时间。也许你说“开始”，或者打开一首歌，或者无论什么。）打开音乐或者无论什么，意味聚会开始。下文“And don't forget to put out some cookies and fruits.
