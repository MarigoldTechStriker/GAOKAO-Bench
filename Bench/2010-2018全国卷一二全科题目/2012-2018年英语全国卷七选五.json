The science  of creating  and reading  coded  \nmessages  is called  cryptography.  \nThere  are three  main  types  of cryptography.     37    For example,  the first \nletters  of “My elephant  eats too many  eels”  spell out the hidden  message  “Meet  me.”  \n   38    You might  represent  each letter  with a number,  for example.  Let’s  \nnumber  the letters  of the alphabet,  in order,  from  1 to 26. If we substitute  a number  for \neach letter,  the message  “Meet  me” would  read “13 5 5 20 13 5.” \nA code  uses symbols  to replace  words,  phrases,  or sentences.  To read the \nmessage  of a real code,  you must  have  a code  book.     39    For example,  \n“bridge”  might  stand  for “meet”  and “out”  might  stand  for “me.”  The message  \n  “Bridge  out” would  actually  mean  “Meet  me.”     40    However,  it is also hard to \nkeep  a code  book  secret  for long.  So codes  must  be changed  frequently.  \nA. It is very hard to break  a code  without  the code  book.  \nB. In any language,  some  letters  are used more  than others.  \nC.

I would  have  laughed  heartily.  Campers,  in my eyes,  were  people  \nwho enjoyed  insect  bites,  ill-cooked  meals,  and uncomfortable  sleeping  bags.  They  \nhad nothing  in common  with me.     36    . \nThe friends  who introduced  me to camping  thought  that it meant  to be a pioneer.     \n37    We sleep  in a tent, cooked  over an open  fire, and walked  a long distance  to \ntake the shower  and use the bathroom.  This brief  visit with Mother  Nature  cost me \ntwo days off from  work,  recovering  from  a bad case of sunburn  and the doctor’s  bill \nfor my son’s  food poisoning.  \nI was, nevertheless,  talked  into going  on another  fun-filled  holiday  in the \nwilderness.    38    Instead,  we had a pop-up  camper  with comfortable  beds and an \nair conditioner.  My nature-loving  friends  had remembered  to bring  all the necessities  \nof life.  \n  39    We have  done  a lot of it since.  Recently,  we bought  a twenty-eight-foot  \ntravel  trailer  complete  with a bathroom  and a built-in  TV set. There  is a separate  \nbedroom,  a modern  kitchen  with a refrigerator.  The trailer  even  has matching  carpet  \nand curtains.   \n  40     It must  be true that sooner  or later,  everyone  finds  his or her way back  \nto nature.  I recommend  that you find your way in style.  \nA. This time there  was no tent. \nB. Things  are going  to be improved.  \nC. The trip they took me on was a rough  one. \nD. I was to learn  a lot about  camping  since  then,  however.  \nE. I must  say that I have  certainly  come  to enjoy  camping.   \n  F. After  the trip, my family  became  quite  interested  in camping.  \nG. There  was no shade  as the trees  were  no more  than 3 feet tall.  ",
