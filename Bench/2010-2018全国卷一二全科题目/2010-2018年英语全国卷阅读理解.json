            "question": "\n \nB \nMany  of us love July because  it’s the month  when  nature’s  berries  and stone  \nfruits  are in abundance.  These  colourful  and sweet  jewels  from  British  Columbia’s  \nfields  are little powerhouses  of nutritional  protection.  \nOf the common  berries,  strawberries  are highest  in vitamin  C, although,  because  \nof their seeds,  raspberries  contain  a little more  protein  (蛋白质 ), iron and zinc (not \nthat fruits  have  much  protein).  Blueberries  are particularly  high in antioxidants  (抗氧\n化 物 质 ). The yellow  and orange  stone  fruits  such as peaches  are high in the \ncarotenoids  we turn into vitamin  A and which  are antioxidants.  As for cherries  (樱桃\n), they are so delicious  who cares?  However,  they are rich in vitamin  C. \nWhen  combined  with berries  or slices  of other  fruits,  frozen  bananas  make  an \nexcellent  base for thick,  cooling  fruit shakes  and low fat “ice cream”.  For this \npurpose,  select  ripe bananas  for freezing  as they are much  sweeter.  Remove  the skin \nand place  them  in plastic  bags or containers  and freeze.  If you like, a squeeze  of fresh  \nlemon  juice  on the bananas  will prevent  them  turning  brown.  Frozen  bananas  will last \nseveral  weeks,  depending  on their ripeness  and the temperature  of the freezer.  \nIf you have  a juicer , you can simply  feed in frozen  bananas  and some  berries  or \nsliced  fruit.  Out comes  a “soft-serve”  creamy  dessert,  to be eaten  right  away.  This \nmakes  a fun activity  for a children’s  party;  they love feeding  the fruit and frozen  \nbananas  into the top of the machine  and watching  the ice cream  come  out below.  \n24. What  does the author  seem  to like about  cherries?  \nA. They  contain  protein.     B. They  are high in vitamin  A. \nC. They  have  a pleasant  taste.    D. They  are rich in antioxidants.  \n25. Why  is fresh  lemon  juice  used in freezing  bananas?  \nA. To make  them  smell  better.   B. To keep  their colour.  \nC. To speed  up their ripening.   D. To improve  their nutrition.  \n26. What  is “a juicer”  in the last paragraph?  \nA. A dessert.      B. A drink.   C. A container.      D. A machine.  \n27. From  which  is the text probably  taken?  \nA. A biology  textbook.           B. A health  magazine.  \nC. A research  paper.             D. A travel  brochure.  ",

            "question": "\n \nC \nTeens  and younger  children  are reading  a lot less for fun, according  to a \nCommon  Sense  Media  report  published  Monday.  \nWhile  the decline  over the past decade  is steep  for teen readers,  some  data in the \nreport  shows  that reading  remains  a big part of many  children’s  lives,  and indicates  \nhow parents  might  help encourage  more  reading.  \nAccording  to the report’s  key findings,  “the proportion  (比例 ) who say they \n‘hardly  ever’  read for fun has gone  from  8 percent  of 13-year-olds  and 9 percent  of \n17-year-olds  in 1984  to 22 percent  and 27 percent  respectively  today.”  \nThe report  data shows  that pleasure  reading  levels  for younger  children,  ages \n2-8, remain  largely  the same.  But the amount  of time spent  in reading  each session  \nhas declined,  from  closer  to an hour or more  to closer  to a half hour per session.  \nWhen  it comes  to technology  and reading,  the report  does little to counsel  (建议\n) parents  looking  for data about  the effect  of e-readers  and tablets  on reading.  It does \npoint  out that many  parents  still limit  electronic  reading,  mainly  due to concerns  \nabout  increased  screen  time.  \nThe most  hopeful  data shared  in the report  shows  clear  evidence  of parents  \nserving  as examples  and important  guides  for their kids when  it comes  to reading.  \nData  shows  that kids and teens  who do read frequently,  compared  to infrequent  \nreaders,  have  more  books  in the home,  more  books  purchased  for them,  parents  who \nread more  often,  and parents  who set aside  time for them  to read.  \nAs the end of school  approaches,  and school  vacation  reading  lists loom  (逼近 ) \nahead,  parents  might  take this chance  to step in and make  their own summer  reading  \nlist and plan a family  trip to the library  or bookstore.  \n28. What  is the Common  Sense  Media  report  probably  about?  \nA. Children’s  reading  habits.         B. Quality  of children’s  books.  \nC. Children’s  after-class  activities.     D. Parent-child  relationships.  \n29. Where  can you find the data that best supports  “children  are reading  a lot less for \nfun”?  \nA. In paragraph  2.              B. In paragraph  3. \nC. In paragraph  4.              D. In paragraph  5. \n30. Why  do many  parents  limit  electronic  reading?  \nA. E-books  are of poor quality.       B. It could  be a waste  of time.  \nC. It may harm  children’s  health.     D. E-readers  are expensive.  \n31. How  should  parents  encourage  their children  to read more?  \nA. Act as role models  for them.    B.

            "question": "\n    \nD \nWe’ve  all been  there:  in a lift, in line at the bank  or on an airplane,  surrounded  \nby people  who are, like us, deeply  focused  on their smartphones  or, worse,  struggling  \nwith the uncomfortable  silence.  \nWhat’s  the problem?  It’s possible  that we all have  compromised  conversational  \nintelligence.  It’s more  likely  that none  of us start a conversation  because  it’s \nawkward  and challenging,  or we think  it’s annoying  and unnecessary.  But the next \ntime you find yourself  among  strangers,  consider  that small  talk is worth  the trouble.  \nExperts  say it’s an invaluable  social  practice  that results  in big benefits.  \nDismissing  small  talk as unimportant  is easy,  but we can’t  forget  that deep  \nrelationships  wouldn’t  even  exist  if it weren’t  for casual  conversation.  Small  talk is \nthe grease  (润滑剂 ) for social  communication,  says Bernardo  Carducci,  director  of \nthe Shyness  Research  Institute  at Indiana  University  Southeast.  “Almost  every  great  \nlove story  and each big business  deal begins  with small  talk,”  he explains.  “The  key \nto successful  small  talk is learning  how to connect  with others,  not just communicate  \nwith them.”  \nIn a 2014  study,  Elizabeth  Dunn,  associate  professor  of psychology  at UBC,  \ninvited  people  on their way into a coffee  shop.  One group  was asked  to seek out an \ninteraction  (互动 ) with its waiter;  the other,  to speak  only when  necessary.  The \nresults  showed  that those  who chatted  with their server  reported  significantly  higher  \npositive  feelings  and a better  coffee  shop  experience.  “It’s not that talking  to the \nwaiter  is better  than talking  to your husband,”  say Dunn.  “But  interactions  with \nperipheral  (边缘的 ) members  of our social  network  matter  for our well-being  also.”  \nDunn  believes  that people  who reach  out to strangers  feel a significantly  greater  \nsense  of belonging,  a bond  with others.  Carducci  believes  developing  such a sense  of \nbelonging  starts  with small  talk. “Small  talk is the basis  of good  manners,”  he says.  \n32. What  phenomenon  is described  in the first paragraph?  \nA. Addiction  to smartphones.  \nB. Inappropriate  behaviours  in public  places.  \nC. Absence  of communication  between  strangers.  \nD. Impatience  with slow  service.  \n33. What  is important  for successful  small  talk according  to Carducci?  \nA. Showing  good  manners.     B. Relating  to other  people.  \nC. Focusing  on a topic.      D. Making  business  deals.  \n34. What  does the coffee-shop  study  suggest  about  small  talk?  \nA. It improves  family  relationships.   B. It raises  people’s  confidence.  \nC. It matters  as much  as formal  talk.  D. It makes  people  feel good.  \n35. What  is the best title for the text?  \nA. Conversation  Counts      B.

            "question": "  \nA \nMy color  television  has given  me nothing  but a headache.  I was able to buy it a \nlittle over a year ago because  I had my relatives  give me money  for my birthday  \ninstead  of a lot of clothes  that wouldn’t  fit. I let a salesclerk  fool me into buying  a \ndiscontinued  model.  I realized  this a day late, when  I saw newspaper  advertisements  \nfor the set at seventy-five  dollars  less than I had paid.  The set worked  so beautifully  \nwhen  I first got it home  that I would  keep  it on until stations  signed  off for the night.  \nFortunately,  I didn’t  got any channels  showing  all-night  movies  or I would  never  have  \ngotten  to bed. \nThen  I started  developing  a problem  with the set that involved  static  (静电 ) \nnoise.  For some  reason,  when  certain  shows  switched  into a commercial,  a loud noise  \nwould  sound  for a few seconds.  Gradually,  this noise  began  to appear  during  a show,  \nand to get rid of it, I had to change  to another  channel  and then change  it back.  \nSometimes  this technique  would  not work,  and I had to pick up the set and shake  it to \nremove  the sound.  I actually  began  to build  up my arm muscles  (肌肉 ) shaking  my \nset. \nWhen  neither  of these  methods  removed  the static  noise,  I would  sit helplessly  \nand wait for the noise  to go away.  At last I ended  up hitting  the set with my fist, and it \nstopped  working  altogether.  My trip to the repair  shop  cost me $62, and the set is \nworking  well now,  but I keep  expecting  more  trouble.  \n21. Why  did the author  say he was fooled  into buying  the TV set? \nA. He got an older  model  than he had expected.  \nB. He couldn’t  return  it when  it was broken.  \nC. He could  have  bought  it at a lower  price.  \n  D.

            "question": "\n \nB \nYour  house  may have  an effect  on your figure.  Experts  say the way you design  \nyour home  could  play a role in whether  you pack  on the pounds  or keep  them  off. You \ncan make  your environment  work  for you instead  of against  you. Here  are some  ways  \nto turn your home  into part of diet plan.  \nOpen  the curtains  and turn up the lights.  Dark  environments  are more  likely  to \nencourage  overeating,  for people  are often  less self-conscious （难为情） when  \nthey’re  in poorly  lit places-and  so more  likely  to eat lots of food.  If your home  doesn’t  \nhave  enough  window  light,  get more  lamps  and flood  the place  with brightness.  \nMind  the colors.  Research  suggests  warm  colors  fuel our appetites.  In one study,  \npeople  who ate meals  in a blue room  consumed  33 percent  less than those  in a yellow  \nor red room.  Warm  colors  like yellow  make  food appear  more  appetizing,  while  cold \ncolors  make  us feel less hungry.  So when  it’s time to repaint,  go blue.  \nDon’t  forget  the clock—or the radio.  People  who eat slowly  tend to consume  \nabout  70 fewer  calories（卡路里） per meal  than those  who rush through  their meals.  \nBegin  keeping  track  of the time,  and try to make  dinner  last at least 30 minutes,  And \nwhile  you’re  at it, actually  sit down  to eat. If you need  some  help slowing  down,  turn \non relaxing  music.

It used to be called  the “year  off” between  school  and university.  The \ngap-year  phenomenon  originated  (起源 ) with the months  left over to Oxbridge  \napplicants  between  entrance  exams  in November  and the start of the next academic  \nyear.  \nThis year,  25,310  students  who have  accepted  places  in higher  education  \ninstitutions  have  put off their entry  until next year,  according  to statistics  on university  \nentrance  provided  by University  and College  Admissions  Service  (UCAS).  \nThat is a record  14.7%  increase  in the number  of students  taking  a gap year.  \nTony  Higgins  from  UCAS  said that the statistics  are good  news  for everyone  in higher  \neducation.  “Students  who take a well-planned  year out are more  likely  to be satisfied  \nwith,  and complete,  their chosen  course.  Students  who take a gap year are often  more  \nmature  and responsible,”  he said. \n  But not everyone  is happy.  Owain  James,  the president  of the National  Union  of \nStudents  (NUS),  argued  that the increase  is evidence  of student  had ship — young  \npeople  are being  forced  into earning  money  before  finishing  their education.  “New  \nstudents  are now aware  that they are likely  to leave  university  up to ￡15,000  in debt.  \nIt is not surprising  that more  and more  students  are taking  a gap year to earn money  to \nsupport  their study  for the degree.  NUS  statistics  show  that over 40% of students  are  \nforced  to work  during  term time and the figure  increases  to 90% during  vacation  \nperiods,”  he said. \n29. What  do we learn  about  the gap year from  the text?  \nA. It is flexible  in length.        B. It is a time for relaxation.  \nC. It is increasingly  popular.     D.

            "question": "\n \nB \nFive years  ago, when  I taught  art at a school  in Seattle,  I used Tinkertoys  as a test \nat the beginning  of a term to find out something  about  my students.  I put a small  set of \nTinkertoys  in front  of each student,  and said:  “Make  something  out of the Tinkertoys.  \nYou have  45 minutes  today  ― and 45 minutes  each day for the rest of the week.”  \nA few students  hesitated  to start.  They  waited  to see what  the rest of the class  \nwould  do. Several  others  checked  the instructions  and made  something  according  to \none of the model  plans  provided.  Another  group  built something  out of their own \nimaginations.  \n  Once  I had a boy who worked  experimentally  with Tinkertoys  in his free time.  \nHis constructions  filled  a shelf  in the art classroom  and a good  part of his bedroom  at \nhome.  I was delighted  at the presence  of such a student.  Here  was an exceptionally  \ncreative  mind  at work.  His presence  meant  that I had an unexpected  teaching  assistant  \nin class  whose  creativity  would  infect  (感染 ) other  students.  \nEncouraging  this kind of thinking  has a downside . I ran the risk of losing  those  \nstudents  who had a different  style  of thinking.  Without  fail one would  declare,  “But  \nI’m just not creative.”  \n“Do you dream  at night  when  you’re  asleep?”  \n“Oh,  sure.”  \n“So tell me one of your most  interesting  dreams.”  The student  would  tell \nsomething  wildly  imaginative.  Flying  in the sky or in a time machine  or growing  three  \nheads.  “That’s  pretty  creative.  Who  does that for you?”  \n“Nobody.  I do it.” \n“Really  ― at night,  when  you’re  asleep?”  \n“Sure.”  \n“Try  doing  it in the daytime,  in class,  okay?”  \n25. The teacher  used Tinkertoys  in class  in order  to ________?  \nA. know  more  about  the students     B. make  the lessons  more  exciting  \nC. raise  the students’  interest  in art   D. teach  the students  about  toy design  \n26.

Now,  the website  \nBookCrossing.com  turns  the page  on the traditional  idea of a book  group.  \nMembers  go on the site and register  the books  they own and would  like to share.  \nBookCrossing  provides  an identification  number  to stick  inside  the book.  Then  the \nperson  leaves  it in a public  place,  hoping  that the book  will have  an adventure,  \ntraveling  far and wide  with each new reader  who finds  it. \nBruce  Pederson,  the managing  director  of BookCrossing,  says,  “The  two things  \nthat change  your life are the people  you meet  and books  you read.

            "question": "\n \nD \nA new collection  of photos  brings  an unsuccessful  Antarctic  voyage  back  to life. \nFrank  Hurley’s  pictures  would  be outstanding  ― undoubtedly  first-rate  \nphoto-journalism  ― if they had been  made  last week.  In fact, they were  shot from  \n1914  through  1916,  most  of them  after a disastrous  shipwreck  (海 难 ), by a \ncameraman  who had no reasonable  expectation  of survival.  Many  of the images  were  \nstored  in an ice chest,  under  freezing  water,  in the damaged  wooden  ship.  \nThe ship was the Endurance , a small,  tight,  Norwegian-built  three-master  that \nwas intended  to take Sir Ernest  Shackleton  and a small  crew  of seamen  and scientists,  \n27 men in all, to the southernmost  shore  of Antarctica’s  Weddell  Sea. From  that point  \nShackleton  wanted  to force  a passage  by dog sled (雪橇 ) across  the continent.  The \njourney  was intended  to achieve  more  than what  Captain  Robert  Falcon  Scott  had \ndone.  Captain  Scott  had reached  the South  Pole early  in 1912  but had died with his \nfour companions  on the march  back.  \nAs writer  Caroline  Alexander  makes  clear  in her forceful  and well-researched  \nstory  The Endurance , adventuring  was even  then a thoroughly  commercial  effort.  \nScott’s  last journey,  completed  as he lay in a tent dying  of cold and hunger,  caught  the \nworld’s  imagination,  and a film made  in his honor  drew  crowds.  Shackleton,  a \nonetime  British  merchant-navy  officer  who had got to within  100 miles  of the South  \nPole in 1908,  started  a business  before  his 1914  voyage  to make  money  from  movie  \nand still photography.  Frank  Hurley,  a confident  and gifted  Australian  photographer  \nwho knew  the Antarctic,  was hired  to make  the images,  most  of which  have  never  \nbefore  been  published.  \n33. What  do we know  about  the photos  taken  by Hurley?  \n  A. They  were  made  last week.         B. They  showed  undersea  sceneries.  \nC. They  were  found  by a cameraman.   D. They  recorded  a disastrous  adventure.  \n34. Who  reached  the South  Pole first according  to the text?  \nA. Frank  Hurley.             B. Ernest  Shackleton.  \nC. Robert  Falcon  Scott.        D. Caroline  Alexander.  \n35. What  does Alexander  think  was the purpose  of the 1914  voyage?  \nA. Artistic  creation.        B. Scientific  research.  \nC. Money  making.         D. Treasure  hunting.  ",

            "question": "\n \nC \nThousands  of people  living  in the Chinese  capital  will celebrate  the start of the \nChinese  New  year by heading  for the ski resorts（滑雪场） . Never  mind  that \nBeijing ’s dry weather  seldom  produces  snow . It is cold enough  in winter  for snow  --- \nmaking  machines  to make  a covering  for the hills north  to the capital . And the rapid  \ngrowth  of a pleasure  --- seeking  middle  class  has formed  the basis  for this new craze\n（热潮） .  \nSince  Beijing ’s first ski resort  was opened  ten years  ago, the sport  has enjoyed  \nastonishing  increase . There  are now more  than a dozen  resorts . Clothes  markets  in the \ncity have  added  bright  colored  ski suits to their winter  collections . Mr. Wei, a \nmanager  of a newly -opened  ski resort  in Beijing , sees the growth  of an industry  that \ncould  soon  lead Chinese  to head  for the ski resorts  of Europe . In recent  years  ski \nresorts  offering  natural  snow  have  opened  in China . But many  are in faraway  areas  of \nthe country  and can’t really  match  the equipment  and services  of some  ski resorts  in \nEurope .  \nBeijing ’s skiing  craze  is partly  a result  of the recent  increase  in private（私有的\n） cars. This has led to the growth  of a leisure  industry  in the capital ’s suburbs（郊区\n）, which  until the late-1990s  were  unreachable  to ordinary  people . According  to Mr.  \nWei, about  40% of the visitors  to his resort  come  in their own cars. The rest are bused  \nin by schools , businesses  or government  offices .  \nThe problem  is making  money . Starting  ski resorts  requires  quite  a lot of money ;  \nhiring  land from  the local  government , preparing  the hills, buying  snow  machines , \nmaking  sure there  are enough  water  and electricity  to run them , and buying  ski \nequipment  for hiring  out to customers .  \nThe ski resort  where  Mr. Wei works  cost nearly  $4m to set up. And as so often  in \nChina  when  someone  comes  up with a good  idea, many  others  hash in and price  wars  \nbreak  out. Beijing  now offers  some  of the cheapest  ski training  classes  in the world , \nthough  with most  people  rather  new to the sport , expecting  a few more  doing  the same  \n  job.  \n50. What  does this text mainly  talk about？　   　 \nA. Convenience  for skiers  brought  about  by private  cars.  \nB. Skiing  as a new way of enjoying  one’s spare  time.  \nC. Things  to be considered  when  starting  a ski resort .  \nD. A sudden  increase  of ski training  classes  in Beijing .  \n51. Why  are some  Chinese  likely  to go skiing  in Europe？　   　 \nA. To visit more  ski areas .              B. To ski on natural  snow .  \nC. For a large  collection  of ski suits.      D. For better  services  and equipment .  \n52.

            "question": "\n   \nE \nHow  words  came  into being  is unknown . All we assume（推测） is that some  \nearly  men invented  certain  sounds , in one way or another , to express  thoughts  and \nfeelings , actions  and things , so that they could  talk with each other . Later  they agreed  \nupon  certain  signs , called  letters , which  could  be put together  to show  those  sounds , \nand which  could  be written  down . Those  sounds , whether  spoken  or written  in letters , \nare called  words .  \nThe power  of words , then, lies in their associations ---the things  they bring  up to \nour minds . Words  become  filled  with meaning  for us by experience ; and the longer  \nwe tire, the more  certain  words  bring  back  to us the happy  and sad events  of our past; \nand the more  we read and learn , the more  the number  of words  that mean  something  \nto us increases .  \nGreat  writers  are those  who not only have  great  thoughts  but also express  these  \nthoughts  in words  which  have  powerful  effects  on our minds  and feelings . This clever  \nuse of words  is what  we call literary  style（文体） . Above  all, the real poet is a \nmaster  of words . He can express  his meaning  in words  which  sing like music , and \nwhich  by their position  and association  can move  men to tears . We should  therefore  \nlearn  to choose  our words  carefully  and use them  correctly , or they will make  our \nspeech  silly and common .  \n58.

When  the studio  \ndidn’t  want  me for the film — it wanted  somebody  as well known  as Paul — he stood  \nup for me. I don’t  know  how many  people  would  have  done  that; they would  have  \nlistened  to their agents  or the studio  powers.  \nThe friendship  that grew  out of the experience  of making  that film and The Sting  \nfour years  later had its root in the fact that although  there  was an age difference,  we \nboth came  from  a tradition  of theater  and live TV. We were  respectful  of craft（技艺\n）and focused  on digging  into the characters  we were  going  to play.  Both  of us had \nthe qualities  and virtues  that are typical  of American  actors:  humorous,  aggressive,  \nand making  fun of each other  — but always  with an underlying  affection.  Those  were  \nalso at the core（核心） of our relationship  off the screen.  \nWe shared  the brief  that if you’re  fortunate  enough  to have  success,  you should  \n  put something  back  — he with his Newman’s  Own  food and his Hole  in the Wall  \ncamps  for kids who are seriously  ill, and me with Sundance  and the institute  and the \nfestival.  Paul and I didn’t  see each other  all that regularly,  but sharing  that brought  us \ntogether.  We supported  each other  financially  and by showing  up at events.  \nI last saw him a few months  ago. He’d  been  in and out of the hospital.  He and I \nboth knew  what  the deal was, and we didn’t  talk about  it. Ours  was a relationship  that \ndidn’t  need  a lot of words.  \n24. Why  was the studio  unwilling  to give the role to author  at first?  \nA. Paul Newman  wanted  it.        B. The studio  powers  didn’t  like his agent.  \nC. He wasn’t  famous  enough.       D. The director  recommended  someone  else. \n25. Why  did Paul and the author  have  a lasting  friendship?  \nA. They  were  of the same  age.       B. They  worked  in the same  theater.  \nC. They  were  both good  actors.       D. They  had similar  charactertics.  \n26. What  does the underlined  word  “that”  in paragraph  3 refer  to? \nA. Their  belief.             B. Their  care for children.  \nC. Their  success.            D. Their  support  for each other.  \n27. What  is the author’s  purpose  in writing  the test? \nA. To show  his love of films.       B.

The Transition,  which  flew at 1,400  feet for eight  \nminutes  last month,  can reach  around  70 miles  per hour on the road and 115 in the air. \nIt flies using  a 23-gallon  tank of gas and bums  5 gallons  per hour in the air. On the \nground,  it gets 35 miles  per gallon.  \nAround  100 people  have  already  put down  a $10,000  deposit  to get a Transition  \nwhen  they go on sale, and those  numbers  will likely  rise after Terrafugia  introduces  \n  the Transition  to the public  later this week  at the New  York  Auto  Show.  But don’t  \nexpect  it to show  up in too many  driveways.  It’s expected  to cost $279,000.  And it \nwon’t  help if you’re  stuck  in traffic.  The car needs  a runway.  \nInventors  have  been  trying  to make  flying  cars since  the 1930s,  according  to \nRobert  Mann,  an airline  industry  expert.  But Mann  thinks  Terrafugia  has come  closer  \nthan anyone  to making  the flying  car a reality.  The govemment  has already  permitted  \nthe company  to use special  materials  to make  it easier  for the vehicle  to fly. The \nTransition  is now going  through  crash  tests to make  sure it meets  federal  safety  \nstandards.  \nMann  said Terrafugia  was helped  by the Federal  Aviation  Administration’s  \ndecision  five years  ago to create  a separate  set of standards  for light sport  aircraft,  \nwhich  are lower  than those  pilots  of larger  planes . Terrafugia  says an owner  would  \nneed  to pass a test and complete  20 hours  of flying  time to be able to fly the \nTransition,  a requirement  pilots  would  find redatively  easy to meet.  \n28. What  is the first paragraph  mainly  about?  \nA. The basic  data of the Transition.      B. The advantages  of flying  cars. \nC. The potential  market  for flying  cars.  D. The designers  of the Transition.  \n29. Why  is the Transition  unlikely  to show  up in too many  driveways?  \nA. It causes  traffic  jams.              B. It is difficult  to operate.  \nC. It is very expensive.               D. It bums  too much  fuel. \n30. What  is the government’s  attitude  to the development  of the flying  car? \nA. Cautious .      B. Favorable.      C. Ambiguous.     D. Disapproving.  \n31. What  is the best title for the text?  \nA. Flying  Car at Auto  Show .          B. The Transition’s  Fist Flight . \nC. Pilots’  Dream  Coming  True .

            "question": "\n \nD \nWhen  a leafy  plant  is under  attack , it doesn’t  sit quietly.  Back  in 1983,  two \nscientists,  Jack Schultz  and Ian Baldwin,  reported  that young  maple  trees  getting  \nbitten  by insects  send out a particular  smell  that neighboring  plants  can get. These  \n  chemicals  come  from  the injured  parts  of the plant  and seem  to be an alarm.  What  the \nplants  pump  through  the air is a mixture  of chemicals  known  as volatile  organic  \ncompounds,  VOCs  for short.  \nScientists  have  found  that all kinds  of plants  give out VOCs  when  being  \nattacked.  It’s a plant’s  way of crying  out. But is anyone  listening?  Apparently.  \nBecause  we can watch  the neighbours  react.  \nSome  plants  pump  out smelly  chemicals  to keep  insects  away.  But others  do \ndouble  duty.  They  pump  out perfumes  designed  to attract  different  insects  who are \nnatural  enemies  to the attackers.  Once  they arrive,  the tables  are turned . The attacker  \nwho was lunching  now becomes  lunch.  \nIn study  after study,  it appears  that these  chemical  conversations  help the \nneighbors.  The damage  is usually  more  serious  on the first plant,  but the neighbors,  \nrelatively  speaking,  stay safer  because  they heard  the alarm  and knew  what  to do. \nDoes  this mean  that plants  talk to each other?  Scientists  don’t  know.  Maybe  the \nfirst plant  just made  a cry of pain or was sending  a message  to its own branches,  and \nso, in effect,  was talking  to itself.  Perhaps  the neighbors  just happened  to “overhear”  \nthe cry. So information  was exchanged,  but it wasn’t  a true, intentional  back  and \nforth.  \nCharles  Darwin,  over 150 years  ago, imagined  a world  far busier,  noisier  and \nmore  intimate  (亲密的 ) than the world  we can see and hear.  Our senses  are weak.  \nThere’s  a whole  lot going  on. \n32. What  does a plant  do when  it is under  attack?  \nA. It makes  noises.      B. It gets help from  other  plants.  \nC. It stands  quietly      D. It sends  out certain  chemicals.  \n33. What  does the author  mean  by “the tables  are turned”  in paragraph  3? \nA. The attackers  get attacked.  \nB. The insects  gather  under  the table.  \nC. The plants  get ready  to fight  back.  \nD. The perfumes  attract  natural  enemies.  \n34.

So far, more  than \n1,800murals （壁画） have  been  painted . Philadelphia  now has more  murals  than any \nother  American  city. \nThe walls  that were  once  ugly with graffiti（涂鸦） are now covered  with \nbeautiful  pictures  of historical  heroes  and modern  art, thanks  to the Mural  Arts \nProgram  （MAP）. Its work  makes  schools  and public  places  attractive , and its \ncitizens  very proud . The program  began  as part of Philadelphia ’s Anti-Graffiti  \nNetwork . Jane Golden  is the MAP ’s artistic  director . “When  people  ask me what  our \nprogram  is about ,” she says, “I answer  them  with one word : hope .” Each  year, the \nMAP  offers  youth  art programs  and workshops . Some  one-time graffiti  writers  even  \n  help paint  MAP  murals . \nThe MAP ’s work , says Golden , is all about  developing  a sense  of community （\n社区） .

An animal  that is aware（意识）of itself  \nhas a high level  of intelligence . \n  Awareness  can be tested  by studying  whether  the animal  recognizes  itself  in the \nmirror , that is, its own reflected  image（反射出的影像） . Many  animals  fail this \nexercise  bitterly , paying  very little attention  to the reflected  image . Only  humans , and \nsome  intelligent  animals  like apes and dolphins , have  shown  to recognize  that the \nimage  in the mirror  is of themselves . \nNow  another  animal  has joined  the club.

With  their large  brains , Reiss  said, \nelephants  “seemed  like cousins  to apes and dolphins .” \nThe researchers  tested  Happy , Maxine  and Patty , three  elephants  at the Bronx  \nZoo. They  put an 8-foot-square  mirror  on a wall of the animals ’ play area（out of the \nsight  of zoo visitors）and recorded  what  happened  with cameras , including  one built \nin the mirror . \nThe elephants  used their long noses  to find what  was behind  it, and to examine  \nparts  of their bodies . \nOf the three , Happy  then passed  the test, in which  a clear  mark  was painted  on \none side of her face.

I thought  he was saying  “we’re \nkind of pleased  you decided  to join us although  I wish  we had hired  someone  else.” \nThen  I discovered  that in American  English  “quite ” sometimes  means  “very”, while  \nin British  English  it means  “fairly ”. \nSo the first lesson  about  working  in other  countries  is to learn  the language  and \nby that I don’t just mean  the words  people  speak . It is body  language , dress , manners , \nideas  and so on. The way people  do things  highlights  many  of the differences  we see \nbetween  cultures（文化） . \nSome  of these  differences  may be only on the surface  --- dress , food and hours  of \nwork  --- while  others  may be deeper  and take longer  to deal with. Mostly , it is just a \nquestion  of getting  used to the differences  and accepting  them , like the climate（气候\n）, while  getting  on with business . \nSome  of the differences  may be an improvement . People  are more  polite ; the \n  service  is better ; you ask for something  to be done  and it happens  without  having  to \nask again . However , other  differences  can be troubling , like punctuality （准时） .

She didn’t  want  \nher children  to miss out on their roots.  “Because  I am Chinese,  my husband  and I \n  wanted  the children  to keep  exposed  to (接触 ) the language  and culture.”  she says.  \n“Staying  with a native  speaker  is better  for children  than simply  sitting  in a \nclassroom,”  says Suzanne  Flynn,  a professor  in language  education  of Children.  “But \nparents  must  understand  that just one year with au pair is unlikely  to produce  \nwonders.   Complete  mastery  demands  continued  learning  until the age of 10 or 12.” \nThe popularity  if au pairs  from  China  has been  strengthened  by the increasing  \nnumbers  of American  parents  who want  their children  who want  their children  to \nlearn  Chinese.

            "question": "\n \nD \nGrown-ups  are often  surprised  by how well they remember  something  they \nlearned  as children  but have  never  practiced  ever since.  A man who has not had a \nchance  to go swimming  for years  can still swim  as well as ever when  he gets back  in \nthe water.  He can get on a bicycle  after many  years  and still ride away.  He can play \ncatch  and hit a ball as well as his son. A mother  who has not thought  about  the words  \nfor years  can teach  her daughter  the poem  that begins  “Twinkle,  twinkle,  little star” or \nremember  the story  of Cinderella  or Goldilocks  and the Three  Bears.  \nOne explanation  is the law of overlearning , which  can be stated  as follows:  Once  \nwe have  learned  something,  additional  learning  trials  increase  the length  of time we \nwill remember  it.                                 \nIn childhood  we usually  continue  to practice  such skills  as swimming,  bicycle  \nriding,  and playing  baseball  long after we have  learned  them.  We continue  to listen  to \nand remind  ourselves  of words  such as “Twinkle,  twinkle,  little star” and childhood  \ntales such as Cinderella  and Goldilocks.  We not only learn  but overlearn.  \nThe multiplication  tables  (乘法口诀表 ) are an exception  to the general  rule that \nwe forget  rather  quickly  the things  that we learn  in school,  because  they are another  of \nthe things  we overlearn  in childhood.  \nThe law of overlearning  explains  why cramming  (突击学习 ) for an examination,  \nthough  it may result  in a passing  grade,  is not a satisfactory  way to learn  a college  \ncourse.  By cramming,  a student  may learn  the subject  well enough  to get by on the \nexamination,  but he is likely  soon  to forget  almost  everything  he learned.  A little \n  overlearning,  on the other  hand,  is really  necessary  for one’s future  development.  \n67. What  is the main  idea of Paragraph  1? \nA. People  remember  well what  they learned  in childhood.  \nB. Children  have  a better  memory  than grown-ups.  \nC. Poem  reading  is a good  way to learn  words.  \nD. Stories  for children  are easy to remember.  \n68. The author  explains  the law of overlearning  by _______.  \nA. presenting  research  findings    B. setting  down  general  rules  \nC. making  a comparison         D. using  examples  \n69. According  to the author,  being  able to use multiplication  tables  is _______.  \nA. a result  of overlearning             B. a special  case of cramming  \nC. a skill to deal with math  problems    D. a basic  step towards  advanced  studies  \n70. What  is the author ’s opinion  on cramming?  \nA. It leads  to failure  in college  exams.     B. It’s helpful  only in a limited  way.  \nC. It’s possible  to result  in poor memory.   D.

            "question": "\n \nB \nGrandparents  Answer  a Call \nAs a third-generation  native  of Brownsville,  Texas,  Mildred  Garza  never  planned  \nto move  away.  Even  when  her daughter  and son asked  her to move  to San Antonio  to \nhelp with their children,  she politely  refused.  Only  after a year of friendly  discussion  \ndid Ms. Garza  finally  say yes. That was four years  ago. Today  all three  generations  \nregard  the move  as a success,  giving  them  a closer  relationship  than they would  have  \nhad in separate  cities.  \nNo statistics  show  the number  of grandparents  like Garza  who are moving  closer  \nto adult  children  and grandchildren.  Yet there  is evidence  suggesting  that the trend  is \n  growing.  Even  President  Obama’s  mother-in-law,  Marian  Robinson,  has agreed  to \nleave  Chicago  and move  into the White  House  to help care for her granddaughters.  \nAccording  to a study  by grandparents.com,  83 percent  of the people  said Mrs. \nRobinson’s  decision  will influence  grandparents  in the American  family.  Two-thirds  \nbelieve  more  families  will follow  the example  of Obama’s  family.  \n“In the 1960s  we were  all a little wild and couldn’t  get away  from  home  far \nenough  or fast enough  to prove  we could  do it on our own,”  says Christine  Crosby,  \npublisher  of Grand , a magazine  for grandparents.  “We now realize  how important  \nfamily  is and how important  it is to be near them,  especially  when  you’re  raising  \nchildren.”  \nMoving  is not for everyone.  Almost  every  grandparent  wants  to be with his or \nher grandchildren  and is willing  to make  sacrifices,  but sometimes  it is wiser  to say no \nand visit frequently  instead.  Having  your grandchildren  far away  is hard,  especially  \nknowing  your adult  child  is struggling,  but giving  up the life you know  may be \nharder.  \n25. Why  was Garza’s  move  a success?  \nA. It strengthened  her family  ties. \nB. It improved  her living  conditions.  \nC. It enabled  her make  more  friends.  \nD. It helped  her know  more  new places.  \n26. What  was the reaction  of the public  to Mrs. Robinson’s  decision?  \nA. 17% expressed  their support  for it. \nB. Few people  responded  sympathetically.  \nC. 83% believed  it had a bad influence.  \nD. The majority  thought  it was a trend.  \n27. What  did Crosby  say about  people  in the 1960s?  \nA. They  were  unsure  of themselves.  \nB. They  were  eager  to raise  more  children.  \nC. They  wanted  to live away  from  their parents.  \nD. They  had little respect  for their grandparents.  \n  28. What  does the author  suggest  the grandparents  do in the last paragraph?  \nA. Make  decisions  in the best interests  of their own.  \nB. Ask their children  to pay more  visits  to them.  \nC. Sacrifice  for their struggling  children.  \nD. Get to know  themselves  better.

            "question": "\n \nD \nThe meaning  of silence  varies  among  cultural  groups.  Silences  may be \nthoughtful,  or they may be empty  when  a person  has nothing  to say. A silence  in a \nconversation  may also show  stubbornness,  uneasiness,  or worry.  Silence  may be \nviewed  by some  cultural  groups  as extremely  uncomfortable;  therefore  attempts  may \nbe made  to fill every  gap (间隙 ) with conversation.  Persons  in other  cultural  groups  \nvalue  silence  and view  it as necessary  for understanding  a person’s  needs.   \nMany  Native  Americans  value  silence  and feel it is a basic  part of \ncommunicating  among  people,  just as some  traditional  Chinese  and Thai persons  do. \nTherefore,  when  a person  from  one of these  cultures  is speaking  and suddenly  stops,  \nwhat  maybe  implied  (暗示 ) is that the person  wants  the listener  to consider  what  has \nbeen  said before  continuing.  In these  cultures,  silence  is a call for reflection.  \nOther  cultures  may use silence  in other  ways,  particularly  when  dealing  with \nconflicts  among  people  or in relationships  of people  with different  amounts  of power.  \nFor example,  Russian,  French,  and Spanish  persons  may use silence  to show  \nagreement  between  parties  about  the topic  under  discussion.  However,  Mexicans  may \nuse silence  when  instructions  are given  by a person  in authority  rather  than be rude to \nthat person  by arguing  with him or her. In still another  use, persons  in Asian  cultures  \nmay view  silence  as a sign of respect,  particularly  to an elder  or a person  in authority.  \nNurses  and other  care-givers  need  to be aware  of the possible  meanings  of \nsilence  when  they come  across  the personal  anxiety  their patients  may be \nexperiencing.  Nurses  should  recognize  their own personal  and cultural  construction  of \nsilence  so that a patient’s  silence  is not interrupted  too early  or allowed  to go on \nunnecessarily.  A nurse  who understands  the healing  (治愈 ) value  of silence  can use \nthis understanding  to assist  in the care of patients  from  their own and from  other  \n  cultures.  \n32. What  does the author  say about  silence  in conversations?  \nA. It implies  anger.              B. It promotes  friendship.  \nC. It is culture-specific.           D. It is content-based.  \n33. Which  of the following  people  might  regard  silence  as a call for careful  thought?  \nA. The Chinese.     B. The French.     C. The Mexicans.    D. The Russians.  \n34.

D. Make  use of its healing  effects.  \n35. What  may be the best title for the text?  \nA. Sound  and Silence               B. What  It Means  to Be Silent  \nC.

            "question": "\n \nC \nLanguages  have  been  coming  and going  for thousands  of years,  but in recent  \ntimes  there  has been  less coming  and a lot more  going.  When  the the world  was still \n  populated  by hunter-gatherers,  small,  tightly  knit (联系 ) groups  developed  their own \npatterns  of speech  independent  of each other.  Some  language  experts  believe  that \n10,000  years  ago, when  the world  had just five to ten million  people,  they spoke  \nperhaps  12,000  languages  between  them.  \nSoon  afterwards,  many  of those  people  started  settling  down  to become  farmers,  \nand their languages  too became  more  settled  and fewer  in number.  In recent  centres,  \ntrade,  industrialisation , the development  of the nation-state  and the spread  of universal  \ncompulsory  education.  Especially  glbalisation  and better  communications  in the past \nfew decades,  all have  caused  many  Languages  to disappear,  and dominant  languages  \nsuch as English . Spanish  and Chinese  are increasingly  taking  over.  \nAt present,  the world  has about  6,800 languages.  The distribution  of these  \nlanguages  is hugely  uneven.  The general  rule is that mild zones  have  relatively  few \nlanguages.  Often  spoken  by many  people  while  hot, wet zones  have  lots, often  spoken  \nby small  numbers.  Europe  has only around  200 Languages:  the Americas  about  1,000.  \nAfrica  2,400; and Asia and the Pacific  perhaps  3,200,  of which  Papua  New  Guinea  \nalone  accounts  for well over 800. The median  number  (中位数 ) of speakers  is a mere  \n6.000,  which  means  that half the worlds  languages  are spoken  by fewer  people  than \nthat. \nAlready  well over 400 of the total of 6,800  languages  are close  to extinction( 消\n亡), with only a few elderly  speakers  left. Pick,  at random,  Busuu  in Cameroon  (eight  \nremaining  speakers),  Chiapaneco  in Mexico(150).  Lipan  Apache  in the United  States  \n(two or three)  or Wadjigu  in Australia  (one,  with a question-mark):  none  of these  \nseems  to have  much  chance  of survival.  \n28. What  can we infer  about  languages  in huntergatherer  times?   \nA.They  developed  very fast.    B. They  were  large  in number.  \nC. They  had similar  patters.     D. They  were  closely  connected  \n29. Which  of the following  best explains  “dominant ” underlined  in paragraph  2？ \nA.Complex.     B. Advanced.       C.Powerful.     D.Modem.  \n30. How  many  languages  are spoken  by less than 6,000  people  at present?    \nA.About  6,800.   B.About  3,400.     C.About  2,400.   D.About  1,200. \n  31.

            "question": "\n \nD \nWe may think  we’re a culture  that gets rid of our worn  technology  at the first \nsight  of something  shiny  and new,  but a new study  shows  that we keep  using  our old \ndevices  (装置 ) well after they go out of style.  That’s  bad news  for the environment  — \nand our wallets  — as these  outdated  devices  consume  much  more  energy  than the \nnewer  ones that do the same  things.  \nTo figure  out how much  power  these  devices  are using,  Callie  Babbitt  and her \ncolleagues  at the Rochester  Institute  of Technology  in New  York  tracked  the \nenvironmental  costs  for each product  throughout  its life — from  when  its minerals  are \nmined  to when  we stop using  the device.  This method  provided  a readout  for how \nhome  energy  use has evolved  since  the early  1990s.  Devices  were  grouped  by \ngeneration  — Desktop  computers,  basic  mobile  phones,  and box-set  TVs defined  \n1992.  Digital  cameras  arrived  on the scene  in 1997.  And MP3  players,  smart  phones,  \nand LCD  TVs entered  homes  in 2002,  before  tablets  and e-readers  showed  up in 2007.  \nAs we accumulated  more  devices,  however,  we didn ’t throw  out our old ones.  \n“The living-room  television  is replaced  and gets planted  in the kids’ room,  and \nsuddenly  one day, you have  a TV in every  room  of the house, ” said one researcher.  \nThe average  number  of electronic  devices  rose from  four per household  in 1992  to 13 \nin 2007.  We’re not just keeping  these  old devices  — we continue  to use them.  \nAccording  to the analysis  of Babbitt ’s team,  old desktop  monitors  and box TVs with \ncathode  ray tubes  are the worst  devices  with their energy  consumption  and \ncontribution  to greenhouse  gas emissions （排放） more  than doubling  during  the \n1992  to 2007  window.  \n  So what ’s the solution（解决方案） ? The team ’s data only went  up to 2007,  but \nthe researchers  also explored  what  would  happen  if consumers  replaced  old products  \nwith new electronics  that serve  more  than one function,  such as a tablet  for word  \nprocessing  and TV viewing.  They  found  that more  on-demand  entertainment  viewing  \non tablets  instead  of TVs and desktop  computers  could  cut energy  consumption  by \n44%.  \n32. What  does the author  think  of new devices?  \nA. They  are environment-friendly.   B. They  are no better  than the old. \nC. They  cost more  to use at home.   D. They  go out of style  quickly.  \n33. Why  did Babbitt's  team  conduct  the research?  \nA. To reduce  the cost of minerals.  \nB. To test the life cycle  of a product.  \nC. To update  consumers  on new technology.  \nD. To find out electricity  consumption  of the devices.  \n34. Which  of the following  uses the least energy?  \nA. The box-set  TV.    B. The tablet.  \nC. The LCD  TV.    D. The desktop  computer.  \n35. What  does the text suggest  people  do about  old electronic  devices?  \nA. Stop using  them.    B. Take  them  apart.  \nC.

I left for the land of warmth  and vitamin  C (维生素\nC), thinking  of beaches  and orange  trees.  When  we touched  down  to blue skies  and \nwarm  air, I sent up a small  prayer  of gratefulness.  Swimming  pools,  wine  tasting,  and \npink sunsets  (at normal  evening  hours,  not 4 in the afternoon)  filled  the weekend,  but \nthe best part — particularly  to my taste,  dulled  by months  of cold — weather  root \nvegetables  — was a 7 a.m. adventure  to the Sarasota  farmers’  market  that proved  to \nbe more  than worth  the early  wake-up  call. \nThe market,  which  was founded  in 1979,  sets up its tents  every  Saturday  from  7 \na.m. to 1 p.m.,  rain or shine,  along  North  Lemon  and State  streets.  Baskets  of perfect  \n  red strawberries,  the red-painted  sides  of the Java Dawg  coffee  truck;  and most  of all, \nthe tomatoes:  amazing,  large,  soft and round  red tomatoes.  \nDisappointed  by many  a broken,  vine-ripened  (蔓上成熟的 ) promise,  I’ve \nrefused  to buy winter  tomatoes  for years.

            "question": "\n \nD \nConflict  is on the menu  tonight  at the café La Chope.  This evening,  as on every  \n  Thursday  night,  psychologist  Maud  Lehanne  is leading  two of France’s  favorite  \npastimes,  coffee  drinking  and the “talking  cure”. Here  they are learning  to get in touch  \nwith their true feelings.  It isn’t always  easy.  The customers  — some  thirty  Parisians  \nwho pay just under  $2 (plus  drinks)  per session  — care quick  to intellectualize  (高谈\n阔论 ), slow  to open  up and connect.  “You are forbidden  to say ‘one feels’  or ‘people  \nthink’ ” Lehanne  told them.  “Say ‘I think,’  ‘Think  me’.”  \nA café society  where  no intellectualizing  is allowed?  It couldn’t  seem  more  \nun-French.  But Lehanne’s  psychology  café is about  more  than knowing  oneself:  It’s \ntrying  to help the city’s  troubled  neighborhood  cafes.  Over  the years,  Parisian  cafes  \nhave  fallen  victim  to changes  in the French  lifestyle  — longer  working  hours,  a fast \nfood boom  and a younger  generation’s  desire  to spend  more  time at home.  Dozens  of \nnew theme  cafes  appear  to change  the situation.  Cafes  focused  around  psychology,  \nhistory,  and engineering  are catching  on, filling  tables  well into the evening.  \nThe city’s  “psychology  cafes ”, which  offer  great  comfort,  are among  the most  \npopular  places.  Middle-aged  homemakers,  retirees,  and the unemployed  come  to such \ncafes  to talk about  love,  anger,  and dreams  with a psychologist.  And they come  to \nLehanne’s  group  just to learn  to say what  they feel. “There’s  a strong  need  in Paris  for \ncommunication, ” says Maurice  Frisch,  a café La Chope  regular  who works  as a \nreligious  instructor  in a nearby  church.  “People  have  few real friends.  And they need  \nto open  up”. Lehanne  says she’d  like to see psychology  cafes  all over France.  “If \npeople  had normal  lives,  these  cafes  wouldn’t  exist, ” she says.  “If life weren’t  a battle,  \npeople  wouldn’t  need  a special  place  just to speak. ” But then,  it wouldn’t  be France.    \n32. What  are people  encouraged  to do at the cafe La Chope?   \nA. Learn  a new subject.    B. Keep  in touch  with friends.   \nC. Show  off their knowledge.   D. Express  their true feelings.   \n33. How  are cafes  affected  by French  lifestyle  changes?   \nA. They  are less frequently  visited.   B. They  stay open  for longer  hours.   \nC. They  have  bigger  night  crowds.   D. They  start to serve  fast food.   \n34. What  are theme  cafes  expected  to do?  \nA. Create  more  jobs.    B. Supply  better  drinks.   \n  C. Save  the cafe business.   D. Serve  the neighborhood.   \n35. Why  are psychology  cafes  becoming  popular  in Paris?   \nA. They  bring  people  true friendship.    \nB. They  give people  spiritual  support.   \nC. They  help people  realize  their dreams.   \nD. They  offer  a platform  for business  links.   ",

            "question": "  \nA \nDoctor  are known  to be terrible  pilots.  They  don’t listen  because  they already  \nknow  it all. I was lucky:  I became  a pilot in 1970,  almost  ten years  before  I graduated  \nfrom  medical  school.  I didn’t realize  then,  but becoming  a pilot makes  me a better  \nsurgeon.  I loved  flying.  As I flew bigger,  faster  planes,  and in worse  weather.  I \nlearned  about  crew  resource  management  (机组资源管理 ), or CRM,  a new idea to \nmake  flying  safer.  It means  that crew  members  should  listen  and speak  up for a good  \nresult,  regardless  of positions.  \nI first read about  CRM  in 1980.  Not long after that, an attending  doctor  and I \nwere  flying  in bad weather.  The controller  had us turn too late to get our landing  \nready.  The attending  doctor  was flying;  I was safety  pilot He was so busy  because  of \nthe bad turn, he had forgotten  to put the landing  gear (起落架 ) down.  He was a better  \npilot --- and my boss --- so it felt unusual  to speak  up. But I had to: Our lives  were  in \ndanger.  I put aside  my uneasiness  and said, “We need  to put the landing  gear down  \nnow! ” That was my first real lesson  in the power  of CRM,  and I’ve used it in the \noperating  room  ever since.  \nCRM  requires  that the pilot/surgeon  encourage  others  to speak  up. It further  \nrequires  that when  opinions  are from  the opposite,  the doctor  doesn ’t overreact,  which  \nmight  prevent  fellow  doctors  from  voicing  opinions  again.  So when  I’m in the \noperating  room,  I ask for ideas  and help from  others.  Sometimes  they’re not willing  to \nspeak  up. But I hope  that if I continue  to encourage  them,  someday  someone  will keep  \nme from  “landing  gear up”. \n56. What  dose the author  say about  doctors  in general?  \nA. They  like flying  by themselves.     B. They  are unwilling  to take advice.  \nC. They  pretend  to be good  pilots.     D. They  are quick  learners  of CRM.  \n57. The author  deepened  his understanding  of the power  of CRM  when_______.  \n  A. he saved  the plane  by speaking  up    B. he was in charge  of a flying  task \nC. his boss landed  the plane  too late     D. his boss operated  on a patient  \n58.

The idea was to reunite  Europe  after the Second  World  War.  \nAt the same  time,  the “Fringe”  appeared  as a challenge  to the official  festival.  \nEight  theatre  groups  turned  up uninvited  in 1947,  in the belief  that everyone  should  \nhave  the right  to perform,  and they did so in a public  house  disused  for years.  \nSoon,  groups  of studentsfirstly  from  Edinburgh  University,  and later from  the \nuniversities  of Oxford  and Cambridge,  Durham  and Birmingham  were  making  the \njourney  to the Scottish  capital  each summer  to perform  theatre  by little-known  writers  \nof plays  in small  church  halls  to the people  of Edinburgh.  \nToday  the “Fringe”,  once  less recognized,  has far outgrown  the festival  with \naround  1,500  performances  of theatre,  music  and dance  on every  one of the 21 days it \nlasts.

            "question": "\n \nB \nPassenger  pigeons（ 旅 鸽 ） once  flew over much  of the United  States  in \nunbelievable  numbers.  Written  accounts  from  the 18th and 19th centuries  described  \nflocks（群） so large  that they darkened  the sky for hours.  \nIt was calculated  that when  its population  reach  its highest  point,  there  were  \nmore  than 3 billion  passenger  pigeons  – a number  equal  to 24 to 40 percent  of the \ntotal bird population  in the United  States,  making  it perhaps  the most  abundant  birds  \nin the world.  Even  as late as 1870  when  their numbers  had already  become  smaller,  a \nflock  believed  to be 1 mile wide  and 320 miles  (about  515 kilometers)  long was seen \nnear Cincinnati.  \nSadly,  the abundance  of passenger  pigeons  may have  been  their undoing . Where  \nthe birds  were  abundant,  people  believed  there  was an ever-lasting  supply  and killed  \nthem  by the thousands.  Commercial  hunters  attracted  them  to small  clearings  with \ngrain,  waited  until pigeons  had settled  to feed,  then threw  large  nets over them,  taking  \nhundreds  at a time.  The birds  were  shipped  to large  cities  and sold in restaurants.  \nBy the closing  decades  of the 19th century,  the hardwood  forests  where  \npassenger  pigeons  nested  had been  damaged  by Americans’  need  for wood,  which  \nscattered（驱散） the flocks  and forced  the birds  to go farther  north,  where  cold \ntemperatures  and spring  storms  contributed  to their decline.  Soon  the great  flocks  \nwere  gone,  never  to be seen again.  \nIn 1897,  the state of Michigan  passed  a law prohibiting  the killing  of passenger  \npigeons,  but by then,  no sizable  flocks  had been  seen in the state for 10 years.  The last \nconfirmed  wild pigeon  in the United  States  was shot by a boy in Pike County,  Ohio,  \nin 1900.  For a time,  a few birds  survived  under  human  care.  The last of them,  known  \naffectionately  as Martha,  died at the Cincinnati  Zoological  Garden  in September  1, \n1914.  \n  24.

The \nflight  was overbooked,  and Delta,  the airline,  offered  us $400  per person  in credits  to \ngive up our seats  and leave  the next day.

Twenty  centimeters  from  her face researchers  have  placed  a white  card with \ntwo black  spots  on it. She stares  at it carefully.  A researcher  removes  the card and \nreplaces  it by another,  this time with the spots  differently  spaced.

Can she tell that the number  two is different  from  three,  \njust 24 hours  after coming  into the world?  \nOr do newborns  simply  prefer  more  to fewer?

A friend  I was talking  to agreed  with me that it was, in his words,  “a \nbrilliantly （精彩地） written  book”.  however,  he then went  on to talk abour  Mr. \nObama  in a way which  suggested  he had no idea of his background  at all. I sensed  \nthat I was talking  to a book  liar. \nAnd it seems  that my friend  is not the only one. Approximately  two thirds  of \npeople  have  lied about  reading  a book  which  they haven’t.

His name  was Mr. Basille.  He wore  a white  cap and \ndrove  a white  truck.  As a 5-year-old  boy, I couldn’t  take my eyes off the coin changer  \nfixed  to his belt. He noticed  this one day during  a delivery  and gave  me a quarter  out \nof his coin changer.  \nOf course,  he delivered  more  than milk.  There  was cheese,  eggs and so on. If we \nneeded  to change  our order,  my mother  would  pen a note- --“Please  add a bottle  of \nbuttermilk  next delivery”- --and place  it in the box along  with the empty  bottles.  And \nthen,  the buttermilk  would  magically  appear.  \nAll of this was about  more  than convenience.  There  existed  a close  relationship  \nbetween  families  and their milkmen.  Mr. Basille  even  had a key to out house,  for \nthose  times  when  it was so cold outside  that we put the box indoors,  so that the milk \nwouldn’t  freeze.  And I remember  Mr. Basille  from  time to time taking  a break  at our \nkitchen  table,  having  a cup of tea and telling  stories  about  his delivery.  \nThere  is sadly  no home  milk delivery  today.  Big companies  allowed  the \nproduction  of cheaper  milk,  thus making  it difficult  for milkmen  to compete.  Besides,  \nmilk is for sale everywhere,  and it may just not have  been  practical  to have  a delivery  \nservice.  \nRecently,  an old milk box in the countryside  I saw brought  back  my childhood  \nmemories.  I took it home  and planted  it on the back  porch(门廊 ). Every  so often  my \nson’s  friends  will ask what  it is.

            "question": "\n \nC \nWhile  small  may be beautiful,  tall is just plain  uncomfortable  it seems,  \nparticularly  when  it comes  to staying  in hotels  and eating  in restaurants.  \nThe Tall Persons  Club  Great  Britain  (TPCGB),  which  was formed  six months  \nago to campaign  for the needs  of the tall, has turned  its attention  to hotels  and \nrestaurants.  Beds  that are too small,  shower  heads  that are too low, and restaurant  \ntables  with hardly  any leg-room  all make  life difficult  for those  of above  average  \n  height,  it says.  \nBut it is not just the extra-tall  whose  needs  are not being  met. The average  night  \nof the population  has been  increasing  ye the standard  size of beds,  doorways,  and \nchairs  has remained  unchanged.  \n“The  bedding  industry  says a bed should  be six inches  larger  than the person  \nusing  it, so even  a king-size  bed at 6′6″(6  feet and 6 inches)  is falling  short  for 25% of \nmen,  while  the standard  6′3″ bed caters  for less than half of the male  population.”  said \nTPCGB  president  Phil Heinricy,  “seven-foot  beds would  work  fine.”  \nSimilarly,  restaurant  tables  can cause  no end of problems.  Small  tables,  which  \nmean  the long-legged  have  to sit a foot or so away  from  them,  are enough  to make  tall \ncustomers  go elsewhere.  \nSome  have  already  taken  note,  however.  At Queens  Moat  Houses′  Caledonian  \nHotel  in Edinburgh,  6′6″beds  are now put in as standard  after requests  for longer  beds \nfrom  taller  visitors,  particularly  Americans.  \n64. What  is the purpose  of the TPCGB  campaign?  \nA. To provide  better  services.             \nB. To rebuild  hotels  and restaurants.  \nC. To draw  public  attention  to the needs  of the tall.   \nD. To attract  more  people  to become  its members.  \n65. Which  of the following  might  be a bed of proper  length  according  to Phil \nHeinricy?  \nA . 7′2″        B. 7′        C. 6′6″        D. 6′3″ \n66. What  may happen  to restaurants  with small  tables?  \nA. They  may lose some  customers.                \nB. They  may start businesses  elsewhere.  \nC. They  have  to find easy chairs  to match  the tables.   \nD. They  have  to provide  enough  space  for the long-legged.  \n67. What  change  has already  been  made  in a hotel  in Edinburgh?  \nA. Tall people  pay more  for larger  beds.      \nB. 6′6″beds  have  taken  the place  of 6′3″beds.  \n  C. Special  rooms  are kept for Americans.      \nD. Guest  rooms  are standardized.  ",

            "question": "\n \nC \nAlong  the river  banks  of the Amazon  and the Orinoco  there  lives  a bird that \nswims  before  it can fly, flies like a fat chicken , eats green  leaves , has the stomach  of a \ncow and has claws（爪） on its wings  when  young . They  build  their homes  about  \n4.6m  above  the river , an important  feature（特征） for the safety  of the young . It is \ncalled  the hoatzin . \nIn appearance , the birds  of both sexes  look very much  alike  with brown  on the \n  back  and cream  and red on the underside . The head  is small , with a large  set of \nfeathers  on the top, bright  red eyes, and blue skin. Its nearest  relatives  are the common  \nbirds , cuckoos . Its most  striking  feature , though , is only found  in the young . \nBaby  hoatzins  have  a claw  on the leading  edge  of each wing  and another  at the \nend of each wing  tip. Using  these  four claws , together  with the beak（喙） , they can \nclimb  about  in the bushes , looking  very much  like primitive  birds  must  have  done . \nWhen  the young  hoatzins  have  learned  to fly, they lose their claws . \nDuring  the drier  months  between  December  and March  hoatzins  fly about  the \nforest  in groups  of 20 to 30 birds , but in April , when  the rainy  season  begins , they \ncollect  together  in smaller  living  units  of two to seven  birds  for producing  purposes . \n63.

For some , an animal  \nprovides  more  comfort  than a husband/wife . A 2002  study  by Karen  Allen  of the State  \nUniversity  of New  York  measured  stress（紧张） levels  and blood  pressure  in people  \n--- half of them  pet owners  --- while  they performed  5 minutes  of mental  arithmetic （\n算术） or held a hand  in ice water . Subjects  completed  the tasks  alone , with a \nhusband/wife , a close  friend  or with a pet. People  with pets did it best. Those  tested  \nwith their animal  friends  had smaller  change  in blood  pressure  and returned  most  \nquickly  to baseline  heart  rates . With  pets in the room , people  also made  fewer  math  \nmistakes  than when  doing  in front  of other  companions . It seems  people  feel more  \nrelaxed（放松） around  pets, says Allen , who thinks  it may be because  pets don’t \njudge . \nA study  reported  last fall suggests  that having  a pet dog not only raises  your \nspirits  but may also have  an effect  on your eating  habits . Researchers  at Northwestern  \nMemorial  Hospital  spent  a year studying  36 fat people  and their equally  fat dogs  on \ndiet-and-exercise  programs ; a separate  group  of 56 people  without  pets were  put on a \ndiet program . On average , people  lost about  I1 pounds , or 5% of their body  weight . \nTheir  dogs  did even  better , losing  an average  of 12 pounds , more  than 15% of their \nbody  weight . Dog owners  didn’t lose any more  weight  than those  without  dogs  but, \nsay researchers , got more  exercise  overall  --- mostly  with their dogs  --- and found  it \nworth  doing . \n67.

According  to Allen , why did the people  do better  with pets around  when  facing  \n  stressful  tasks ? 　   　 \nA. They  have  lower  blood  pressure .     B. They  become  more  patient . \nC. They  are less nervous .             D. They  are in higher  spirits . \n70.

Trying  to help injured,  displaced  or sick creatures  \ncan be heartbreaking;  survival  is never  certain.  However,  when  it works,  it is simply  \nbeautiful.  \n I got a rescue  call from  a woman  in Muttontown.  She had found  a young  owl (猫\n头鹰 ) on the ground.  When  I arrived,  I saw a 2-to 3-week-old  owl. It had already  been  \nplaced  in a carrier  for safety.  \n I examined  the chick  (雏鸟 ) and it seemed  fine. If I could  locate  the nest, I might  \nhave  been  able to put it back,  but no luck.  My next work  was to construct  a nest and \nanchor  it in a tree. \n The homeowner  was very helpful.  A wire basket  was found.  I put some  pine \nbranches  into the basket  to make  this nest safe and comfortable.  I placed  the chick  in \nthe nest, and it quickly  calmed  down.  \n Now  all that was needed  were  the parents,  but they were  absent.  I gave  the \nhomeowner  a recording  of the hunger  screams  of owl chicks.  These  advertise  the \npresence  of chicks  to adults;  they might  also encourage  our chick  to start calling  as \nwell.  I gave  the owner  as much  information  as possible  and headed  home  to see what  \nnews  the night  might  bring.  \n A nervous  night  to be sure,  but sometimes  the spirits  of nature  smile  on us all! \n  The homeowner  called  to say that the parents  had responded  to the recordings.  I drove  \nover and saw the chick  in the nest looking  healthy  and active.  And it was \naccompanied  in the nest by the greatest  sight  of all — LUNCH!  The parents  had done  \ntheir duty and would  probably  continue  to do so. \n24. What  is unavoidable  in the author’s  rescue  work  according  to paragraph  1? \nA.

            "question": "\n \nC \nSome  of the world’s  most  famous  musicians  recently  gathered  in Paris  and New  \nOrleans  to celebrate  the first annual  International  Jazz Day.  UNESCO(  United  \nNations  Educational,  Scientific  and Cultural  Organization)  recently  set April  30 as a \nday to raise  awareness  of jazz music,  its significance,  and its potential  as a unifying  (\n联合 ) voice  across  cultures.  \nDespite  the celebrations,  though,  in the U.S. the jazz audience  continues  to \nshrink  and grow  older,  and the music  has failed  to connect  with younger  generations.  \nIt’s Jason  Moran’s  job to help change  that. As the Kennedy  Center’s  artistic  \nadviser  for jazz, Moran  hopes  to widen  the audience  for jazz, make  the music  more  \naccessible,  and preserve  its history  and culture.  \n“Jazz  seems  like it’s not really  a part of the American  appetite,”  Moran  tells \nNational  Public  Radio’s  reporter  Neal  Conan.  “What  I’m hoping  to accomplish  is that \nmy generation  and younger  start to reconsider  and understand  that jazz is not black  \nand write  anymore.  It’s actually  color,  and it’s actually  digital.”  \n  Moran  says one of the problems  with jazz today  is that the entertainment  aspect  \nof the music  has been  lost. “The  music  can’t  be presented  today  the way it was in \n1908  or 1958.  It has to continue  to move,  because  the way the world  works  is not the \nsame,”  says Moran.  \nLast year,  Moran  worked  on a project  that arranged  Fats Waller’s  music  for a \ndance  party,  “Just  to kind of put it back  in the mind  that Waller  is dance  music  as \nmuch  as it is concert  music,”  says Moran.  “For me, it’s the recontextualization.  In \nmusic,  where  does the emotion  (情感 ) lie? Are we, as humans,  gaining  any insight  (\n感悟 ) on how to talk about  ourselves  and how something  as abstract  as a Charlie  \nParker  record  gets us into a dialogue  about  our emotions  and our thoughts?  \nSometimes  we lose sight  that the music  has a wider  context,”  says Moran,  “so I want  \nto continue  those  dialogues.  Those  are the things  I want  to foster.”  \n28. Why  did UNESCO  set April  30 as International  Jazz Day?  \nA. To remember  the birth  of jazz. \nB. To protect  cultural  diversity.  \nC. To encourage  people  to study  music.  \nD. To recognize  the value  of jazz. \n29. What  does the underlined  word  “that”  in paragraph  3 refer  to? \nA. Jazz becoming  more  accessible.  \nB. The production  of jazz growing  faster.  \nC. Jazz being  less popular  with the young.  \nD. The jazz audience  becoming  larger.   \n30. What  can we infer  about  Moran’s  opinion  on jazz?  \nA. It will disappear  gradually.          B. It remains  black  and white.  \nC. It should  keep  up with the times.     D. It changes  every  50 years.  \n31. Which  of the following  can be the best title for the text?  \nA. Exploring  the Future  of Jazz.     B. The Rise and Fall of Jazz.  \nC. The Story  of a Jazz Musician.     D. Celebrating  the Jazz Day.  ",

            "question": "\n \nD \n  A buld-it-yourself  solar  still（蒸馏器 ）is one of the best ways  to obtain  drinking  \nwater  in areas  where  the liquid  is not readily  available.  Developed  by two doctors  in \nthe U.S. Department  of Agriculture,  it’s an excellent  water  collector.  Unfortunately,  \nyou must  carry  the necessary  equipment  with you, since  it’s all but impossible  to find \nnatural  substitutes.  The only components  required,  though,  are a 5'×5'  sheet  of clear  or \nslightly  milky  plastic,  six feet of plastic  tube,  and a container  — perhaps  just a \ndrinking  cup — to catch  the water.  These  pieces  can be folded  into a neat little pack  \nand fastened  on your belt. \n    To construct  a working  still, use a sharp  stick  or rock to dig a hole four feet \nacross  and three  feet deep.  Try to make  the hole in a damp  area to increase  the water  \ncatcher’s  productivity.  Place  your cup in the deepest  part of the hole.  Then  lay the \ntube in place  so that one end rests all the way in the cup and the rest of the line runs \nup — and out — the side of the hole.  \nNext,  cover  the hole with the plastic  sheet,  securing  the edges  of the plastic  with \ndirt and weighting  the sheet’s  center  down  with a rock.  The plastic  should  now form  a \ncone  (圆锥体 ) with 45-degree-angled  sides.  The low point  of the sheet  must  be \ncentered  directly  over,  and no more  than three  inches  above,  the cup.  \nThe solar  still works  by creating  a greenhouse  under  the plastic.  Ground  water  \nevaporates  (蒸发 ) and collects  on the sheet  until small  drops  of water  form,  run down  \nthe material  and fall off into the cup. When  the container  is full, you can suck the \nrefreshment  out through  the tube,  and won’t  have  to break  down  the still every  time \nyou need  a drink.   \n32. What  do we know  about  the solar  still equipment  from  the first paragraph?  \nA. It’s delicate.    B. It’s expensive.    C. It’s complex.    D. It’s portable.  \n33. What  does the underlined  phrase  “the water  catcher”  in paragraph  2 refer  to? \nA. The tube.       B. The still.       C. The hole.       D. The cup. \n34. What’s  the last step of constructing  a working  solar  still?  \nA. Dig a hole of a certain  size.       B. Put the cup in place.  \nC. Weight  the sheet’s  center  down.     D. Cover  the hole with the plastic  sheet.  \n35. When  a solar  still works,  drops  of water  come  into the cup form           . \n  A. the plastic  tube            B. outside  the hole \nC. the open  air               D. beneath  the sheet  ",
